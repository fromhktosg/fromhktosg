<p>In an <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-healthcare/">earlier article</a>, I talked about the healthcare system in Singapore and how robust it is, be it in the public or private sector. Since then, a few readers have asked me to recommend my go-to doctors so here’s my curated list of the best doctors, hospitals and clinics in Singapore.</p>

<p>In general, I’m a big fan of Raffles Hospital but have slowly begun seeing more doctors in Gleneagles as I think the nurses at Raffles aren’t that great. P.S. - yes, I have a lot of health problems so I’ve seen a lot of doctors.</p>

<p>Gleneagles, Mount Elizabeth, Raffles Hospital. These are the best.</p>
