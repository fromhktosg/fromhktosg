Welcome to my blog, FHK2SG, a place where I share my unique perspectives and experience of moving from Hong Kong to Singapore.

I was born and raised in Hong Kong and spent 18 golden years growing up there. After a short stint in the States for college and work, I moved to Singapore to pursue a new career opportunity at a big tech company and have since settled into the country for the past 5 years. 

People often compare Hong Kong with Singapore and deservedly so. Both places are Asia powerhouses with a small land mass but a huge amount of economic opportunity. In recent years, more and more Hong Kong-ers have opted to move to Singapore, driven by an increasing number of reasons. With many friends reaching out on how life in Singapore is compared to Hong Kong, I'd thought I share my own personal experience, anecdotes and hacks on smoothly transitioning to live in Singapore.

Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss more.
