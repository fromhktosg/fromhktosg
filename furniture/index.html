<h4 id="what-to-watch-out-for-when-buying-furniture">What to watch out for when buying furniture</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Quality - Make sure that the furniture you are purchasing is made of high-quality materials and is built to last. Look for solid wood construction (especially for wardrobes), sturdy joints, and high-quality finishes.</li>
  <li>Comfort - Test out chairs, sofas, sofa beds, and mattresses to make sure that they are comfortable and provide adequate support.</li>
  <li>Size and Scale - When buying furniture, it’s important to consider the size and scale of the piece in relation to the room it will be placed in. A large, bulky sofa may look great in a showroom, but it may overwhelm a small living room. Make sure that the furniture you are purchasing fits the space and complements the other pieces in the room.</li>
  <li>Functionality - Consider how the furniture will be used and whether it is functional for your needs. For example, if you have children or pets, you may want to opt for furniture that is easy to clean and durable. If you work from home, you may need a desk or office chair that provides adequate support for long periods of sitting.</li>
  <li>Price - Price is always a consideration when making a purchase, but it’s important to balance price with quality. While you may be tempted to opt for cheaper furniture, it may end up costing you more in the long run if it needs to be replaced frequently. Consider investing in higher-quality pieces that will last for years to come.</li>
  <li>Delivery and Assembly - Finally, consider the logistics of getting the furniture to your home. Make sure that the store offers delivery and assembly services and factor these costs into your budget</li>
  <li>Vibe - Make sure your furniture pieces complement each other. Getting an ID can always help with this</li>
</ul>

<p>My furniture combination arises from these stores. Most if not all of these do delivery and assembly so no need to fret if you cannot wield a screwdriver.</p>

  <li>Crate and barrel - quality furniture at mid to aspirational price points (now closed in Apr 2023)</li>
