<p>I have vivid memories of my post-school hours in Hong Kong, where I would slug myself from schools to various tuition centers, immersing myself in a whirlwind of enrichment education. Why? I felt pressured to get ahead of the school curve and be top of the assessment syllabi. It wasn’t my parents who gave me this pressure. It was pressure put on myself.</p>

<p>Education in both Hong Kong and Singapore is seen as a key to success and upward mobility given the emphasis on hard work and achievement. As such, their education systems have been developed to ensure that their citizens are equipped with the necessary skills to compete in the global market. However, while both countries’ education systems have similarities, there are also significant differences in terms of their structure, curriculum, and teaching methods. Today, we’ll unpack the education in Singapore. We’ll save the discussions on enrichment education for another time.</p>

<h4 id="hong-kongs-local-education-system">Hong Kong’s local education system</h4>
<p>Hong Kong’s local education system is a product of the British colonial legacy. It consists of six years of primary education, three years of junior secondary education, and three years of senior secondary education. At the end of senior secondary education, students take the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) examination, which determines their eligibility for university admission. The HKDSE is considered one of the most competitive high school exams in the world, with students required to achieve high grades in multiple subjects to secure a place in a prestigious university.</p>

<h4 id="singapores-local-education-system">Singapore’s local education system</h4>
<p>Singapore’s education system follows a more centralized and standardized approach. It consists of six years of primary education, four years of secondary education, and two to three years of post-secondary education (aka Junior college or JC). Students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) at the end of primary school, which determines their eligibility for secondary school. At the end of secondary school, students take the General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (GCE O-level) examination, which determines their eligibility for post-secondary education. Students who wish to pursue higher education must take the GCE Advanced Level (GCE A-level) examination, which is similar to the HKDSE.</p>

<h4 id="the-similarities">The similarities</h4>
<p>The main similarity between Hong Kong and Singapore’s education systems is the emphasis on rote learning, memorization and academic performance. The contrast for international schools or a US education system is the emphasis on creativity, problem solving and critical thinking. Both schools of systems have their own pros and cons, although a western one seems more practical in today’s day and age.</p>

<h4 id="the-differences">The differences</h4>
<p>One of the differences is the language of instruction. In Hong Kong, Cantonese is the primary language of instruction, with English taught as a second language. However, with the increasing influence of mainland China, there has been a growing emphasis on Mandarin. In contrast, Singapore’s education system is bilingual, with English and Mandarin taught as the two official languages.</p>

<p>In terms of resources, both Hong Kong and Singapore have well-funded education systems. However, Singapore has invested heavily in educational technology, with many schools incorporating digital learning tools and platforms into their curriculum. Hong Kong, on the other hand, has faced criticism for its lack of investment in educational technology, with many schools still relying on traditional teaching methods. Montessori schools are also very popular in Singapore if that education system suits your child.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-international-schools">What about international schools?</h4>

<p>There are several reasons why someone might choose to attend an international school in Singapore over a local school:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Curriculum: International schools often offer a broader and more diverse curriculum than local schools. They may also follow international standards, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, which can provide students with a globally recognized education. Less focused on hard facts</li>
  <li>Language: Many international schools in Singapore offer bilingual programs or instruction in languages other than English, which can be a valuable skill in an increasingly globalized world.</li>
  <li>Cultural Diversity: International schools attract students from all over the world, which creates a diverse student body that can expose students to different cultures and perspectives.</li>
  <li>Exposure to international universities: Attending an international school can also provide students with more opportunities to explore and apply to universities abroad, as many international schools have connections to universities around the world.</li>
  <li>Networking: The international environment of an international school can provide students with valuable networking opportunities, both during their time at school and after graduation.</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, there are also advantages to attending a local school in Singapore, such as a stronger focus on Singaporean culture and the local education system, as well as potentially lower costs. Ultimately, the decision to attend an international school or a local school depends on the individual’s goals and priorities.</p>

<p>Getting into an international school in Singapore</p>
<ul>
  <li>It can be competitive, especially if there is a long waitlist. Some tips</li>
  <li>Start early: It’s best to begin the application process as early as possible, ideally a year in advance. This will give you more time to prepare, and you’ll be able to apply before the school reaches its capacity.</li>
  <li>Know your advantage - i.e. holding an American passport or working for an American company can give you priority in the waitlist</li>
  <li>Donating - donating money doesn’t guarantee a spot in an international school, but provides a competitive advantage</li>
  <li>Attend open houses: Attend open houses or information sessions offered by the school to get a better understanding of the school’s culture and academic program. This can also give you a chance to meet with school representatives and ask questions.</li>
  <li>Stay in touch: Keep in touch with the school and check in periodically to see if there have been any updates regarding your application status. This shows your continued interest in the school and may help you stand out from other applicants.</li>

<h4 id="top-international-schools-and-their-fees-in-singapore">Top international schools and their fees in singapore</h4>

<p>These schools are akin to Hong Kong international school (HKIS) and any of the ESF schools.</p>

<ul>
  <li>United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA) - UWCSEA is a leading international school in Singapore that offers a challenging and holistic education to students from over 70 countries.

  <li>Dulwich College International is a network of international schools with campuses in Asia, including Singapore. Dulwich College (Singapore) offers a British-style education to students from age 2 to 18 years old. The school fees for the academic year 2023-2024 at Dulwich College (Singapore) are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Nursery (Age 2): SGD 27,658 per year</li>
      <li>Early Years (Age 3-4): SGD 36,201 per year</li>
      <li>Primary School (Age 5-10): SGD 39,160 to SGD 43,406 per year</li>
      <li>Junior School (Age 11-13): SGD 43,649 per year</li>
      <li>Senior School (Age 14-18): SGD 46,481 to SGD 49,207 per year</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, international school prices can be ridiculously high, and almost as expensive as College in the US. Is it worth it? That’s a personal decision for each household. Speaking from someone who attended international school, the benefits I see are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Less pressure than my peers in international school</li>
  <li>Mastery of spoken English</li>
  <li>Exposure to more academic subjects, versus being siloed into arts, sciences, literature</li>
  <li>Availability of extracurricular activities (covered by the school)</li>
  <li>Network of friends who are of higher socio-economic status (I don’t select friends based on how much money they have but values are at least somewhat similar)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, school fees were more affordable back in the days and not everyone has the luxury to afford international school. However, I think I benefited immensely from the international school system and I would strive to provide the same for my own children.</p>
