Running: the activity we love to hate but can’t seem to quit, especially when it comes to sweating through Singapore’s tropical heat. Whether you’re chasing fitness goals, a personal best, or just running away from your problems (figuratively, of course), it turns out this daily grind does wonders for your body—science says so. But let’s not forget the unsung heroes of every runner’s journey: the shoes that take the pounding. From cross-country terrains to casual park jogs, there’s a dizzying array of running shoes tailored for every style and purpose. And with brands like Adidas, Hoka, Nike, and Brooks battling it out, picking the best pair might just be the most exhausting part of your fitness journey.

### Why do people like running in Singapore?

People in Singapore seem to enjoy running for a mix of reasons, ranging from practical to personal (and occasionally questionable). For one, it’s a convenient way to stay fit without needing a gym membership—just lace up your shoes and step outside. The scenic running paths, like East Coast Park and Marina Bay, provide stunning views that almost make you forget you’re sweating buckets in 30°C humidity. Some people enjoy the sense of accomplishment, whether it’s completing a 5K or just surviving the first kilometer without collapsing. And let’s not overlook the social aspect—Singapore’s running clubs and marathons make it feel less like exercise and more like a community event where everyone’s suffering together.

### What does running once a day help with on a scientific angle?

Running once a day isn’t just about looking good in your workout gear; it actually brings some impressive scientific benefits, backed by stats. It can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by up to 30%, according to research from the British Journal of Sports Medicine, as it strengthens your heart and improves blood circulation. Regular running also releases endorphins—those magical “feel-good” chemicals—which is why 82% of runners report improved moods after their workouts. It burns about 100 calories per mile on average, making it a great way to maintain a healthy weight while strengthening bones and improving muscle tone. Plus, studies show that people who exercise regularly, including running, are 60% less likely to experience anxiety or depression, proving that a daily jog is essentially a mental health booster on top of everything else.
