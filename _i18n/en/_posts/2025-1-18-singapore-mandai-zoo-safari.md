Mandai, Singapore’s self-proclaimed gateway to the wild, offers more than just a peek at animals lounging in their curated habitats—it’s a full-blown attempt to turn conservation into a lifestyle. From its storied beginnings as the modest Singapore Zoo to the ambitious transformation of the entire precinct, Mandai now houses attractions like the River Safari and the newly relocated Bird Paradise, all while dreaming up even more ways to lure you into nature (or what’s left of it). Beyond the flashy facelifts, Mandai's history and evolving blueprint reveal a curious mix of nostalgia and innovation, proving that even wildlife has to adapt to Singapore’s knack for reinvention.

### What is Mandai Singapore?

Mandai Wildlife Group, a self-funded organization based in Singapore, manages the Mandai Wildlife Reserve, encompassing attractions such as the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Wonders, and Bird Paradise. The Group operates under the ownership of Mandai Park Holdings (MPH), which is entirely owned by Temasek Holdings. In 2015, Temasek partnered with the Singapore Government to rejuvenate the Mandai precinct into an integrated wildlife and nature heritage destination. This collaboration led to the establishment of Mandai Nature in 2020, a joint initiative by Temasek and MPH aimed at advancing conservation efforts in Singapore and Asia.

### History of Mandai precinct

Mandai’s origins as a wildlife destination trace back to the vision of Dr. Goh Keng Swee, Singapore’s then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, in the late 1960s. Inspired by visits to renowned zoos overseas, he saw the potential to create a world-class zoological park in Singapore, both for recreation and education. Backed by the government, this idea materialized with the establishment of the Singapore Zoo in 1973 on the shores of the Seletar Reservoir in Mandai. Dr. Goh’s forward-thinking approach ensured the zoo featured open enclosures that mimicked natural habitats, a groundbreaking concept at the time and a hallmark of Singapore’s commitment to wildlife innovation.
Over the years, Mandai grew into Singapore’s premier wildlife hub, with the Night Safari opening in 1994 and the River Safari (now River Wonders) debuting in 2013. Meanwhile, the iconic Jurong Bird Park, located in the west since 1971, operated independently as a flagship attraction. In a bid to centralize Singapore’s wildlife experiences, the bird park relocated to Mandai in 2023, rebranded as Bird Paradise. This move not only expanded the precinct’s offerings but also reinforced Mandai as the ultimate destination for nature enthusiasts and conservation advocates.
Old parts of the mandai precinct

The Mandai precinct’s rich history is rooted in its iconic attractions, each contributing a unique experience to Singapore’s wildlife offerings. From the groundbreaking Singapore Zoo to the world’s first nocturnal park and a river-themed wonderland, these "old" parts of Mandai have been instrumental in shaping its reputation as a premier destination for nature and conservation. Here’s a closer look at the Zoo, Night Safari, and River Wonders, which continue to captivate visitors with their innovative concepts and commitment to wildlife preservation.

<u>Singapore Zoo<u>

The Singapore Zoo, established in 1973, is the cornerstone of the Mandai precinct and widely recognized as one of the world’s best rainforest zoos. It is famed for its open-concept enclosures that simulate natural habitats, offering visitors an immersive experience with over 4,200 animals across 300 species. Iconic exhibits include the orangutans swinging freely on treetop platforms and the white tigers lounging in a lush, forested setting. Beyond its exhibits, the zoo has also played a crucial role in conservation efforts, breeding endangered species like the pygmy hippopotamus and Malayan tiger while educating millions about wildlife preservation.

<u>Night Safari<u>

The Night Safari, launched in 1994, was the first nocturnal wildlife park in the world, a trailblazer that redefined how we engage with animals. This innovative experience lets visitors explore various geographical zones under the cover of darkness, showcasing creatures like Malayan tapirs, fishing cats, and spotted hyenas. Its star attractions include the tram ride, which offers a guided journey through diverse ecosystems, and the popular Creatures of the Night show. By creating a seamless blend of entertainment and education, the Night Safari has become a global icon in nocturnal wildlife experiences.

<u>River Wonders<u>

Opened in 2013 as Asia’s first and only river-themed wildlife park, River Wonders brings the magic of freshwater ecosystems to life. The park highlights iconic rivers like the Amazon, Nile, and Yangtze, housing animals such as manatees, giant river otters, and the critically endangered Mekong giant catfish. Its crown jewel is the Giant Panda Forest, home to Kai Kai and Jia Jia, Singapore’s beloved panda pair. The park seamlessly combines interactive exhibits, scenic boat rides, and conservation messaging, making it a unique addition to Mandai’s attractions.
New parts of the mandai precinct

The Mandai precinct isn’t just about wildlife attractions—it’s a bold vision of conservation, education, and eco-tourism coming together in one cohesive destination. While its storied past gave us beloved icons like the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, and River Wonders, Mandai is now stepping into the future with exciting new additions. From the vibrant Bird Paradise to sustainable hospitality options and the ambitious Forest Corridor, the precinct is transforming into a comprehensive haven where nature thrives alongside human curiosity. Together, these elements solidify Mandai as not just a wildlife hub but a symbol of Singapore’s dedication to innovation and environmental stewardship.

<u>Bird Paradise<u>

The Bird Paradise, which opened in 2023 as the relocated and reimagined version of the iconic Jurong Bird Park, is a feathered jewel in the Mandai precinct. Spanning 17 hectares, it features sprawling aviaries designed to mimic the natural habitats of its avian residents, from the lush Southeast Asian rainforest to the African Savannah. With over 3,500 birds representing 400 species, Bird Paradise offers immersive experiences such as walk-in aviaries and interactive feeding sessions. This rebranding and relocation signify Mandai’s commitment to consolidating wildlife experiences while enhancing education and conservation efforts for endangered bird species.

<u>Hospitality<u>

Mandai has expanded beyond wildlife attractions to include eco-friendly hospitality options, making it a full-fledged nature retreat. At the heart of this is Banyan Tree Mandai, a luxury eco-resort nestled within the precinct that offers visitors a tranquil escape surrounded by lush greenery. Guests can enjoy exclusive wildlife encounters, such as behind-the-scenes tours and guided nature walks, while staying in accommodations designed to blend harmoniously with the environment. By incorporating these hospitality offerings, Mandai transforms from a day trip into an overnight destination, catering to travelers seeking both adventure and relaxation.

<u>The Forest Corridor and Other New Additions<u>

Mandai’s redevelopment also includes the ambitious Forest Corridor, a 2-kilometer ecological link that connects surrounding nature reserves, creating a vital passageway for wildlife like macaques and pangolins. This project emphasizes biodiversity preservation while allowing visitors to explore the natural wonders of Singapore's rainforests. Other additions include eco-play areas, dining options, and educational centers that aim to foster a deeper connection between humans and nature. These efforts highlight Mandai’s vision to blend recreation, conservation, and education in a sustainable, forward-thinking manner.

### How to Support Wildlife in Singapore

1. Visit Mandai’s Attractions Responsibly

Spend a day at the Singapore Zoo, Bird Paradise, or Night Safari, where your ticket helps fund conservation programs and wildlife rehabilitation efforts. These attractions actively support breeding programs for endangered species and research on wildlife sustainability.

2. Volunteer with Conservation Organizations

Join initiatives by groups like Mandai Nature, NParks, WWF Singapore, or ACRES, which focus on habitat restoration, wildlife monitoring, and community outreach. Programs like tree planting or beach cleanups directly contribute to preserving Singapore’s ecosystems, while ACRES focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife in need.

3. Adopt a Wildlife Ambassador

Through Mandai Wildlife Group’s adoption program, you can sponsor animals like orangutans, giant pandas, or even pangolins. Your contributions go towards their care, medical needs, and habitat improvements, ensuring these creatures thrive.


4. Support Local Conservation Projects

Contribute to or participate in projects by WWF Singapore, the Singapore Pangolin Working Group, or the Butterfly Circle. These organizations focus on specific species, ensuring niche but vital ecosystems are protected, whether it's for endangered pangolins or the conservation of Singapore’s native butterflies.

5. Practice Eco-Friendly Living

Make small changes in daily habits, like reducing plastic usage, recycling, or opting for sustainable products, to minimize harm to local wildlife. Singapore’s urbanization affects animal habitats, so environmentally conscious actions—like keeping trash out of green spaces—help protect these creatures’ homes.

Mandai is more than just a wildlife destination—it’s a testament to Singapore’s dedication to conservation, education, and sustainable living. Whether you’re exploring the iconic zoo, marveling at the Bird Paradise, or enjoying a serene stay at Banyan Tree Mandai, the precinct offers something for everyone while supporting vital efforts to protect nature. So why not make your next outing a visit to Mandai? It’s an adventure for you and a step forward for wildlife.
