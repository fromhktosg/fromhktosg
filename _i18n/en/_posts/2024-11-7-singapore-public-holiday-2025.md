### Why does each religion have the same amount of public holidays in singapore?

In Singapore, each major religious group—primarily Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam—has 
an equal number of public holidays to promote a sense of balance, harmony, and inclusiveness in a 
multicultural society. This approach helps manage religious diversity and respects the unique 
cultural practices of each group, aiming to minimize potential conflicts. By giving each community 
the same number of holidays, Singapore upholds a neutral stance, avoiding favoritism that could 
lead to social division or tension.

This strategy reflects the government’s pragmatic approach to national unity, where harmony is 
prioritized over religious or cultural dominance. The equality of public holidays is thus part of 
Singapore’s broader policy of maintaining social stability and fostering a cohesive national 
identity in a religiously diverse population.

I think it’s a little extreme for the government to balance unity to such an extent, but whatever 
works.

### Highlighting a few public holidays you may not know about

Here’s an expanded look at selected public holidays in Singapore:

Chinese New Year  
The most significant holiday for Singapore’s Chinese community, Chinese New Year marks the beginning of the lunar calendar. Festivities last up to 15 days and include family gatherings, 
feasts, lion dances, and the exchange of red packets (ang baos) containing money, symbolizing luck 
and prosperity. Popular locations like Chinatown are adorned with decorations and filled with 
markets, making it a colorful celebration of unity and tradition.

Good Friday  
Good Friday is a solemn Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Observed 
by Singapore’s Christian community, this day is marked by special church services, prayers, and 
hymns reflecting on themes of sacrifice and forgiveness. Some Christians also engage in quiet 
reflection or charitable activities as a way of honoring the meaning behind the holiday.

Hari Raya Puasa (Eid al-Fitr)  
Known locally as Hari Raya Puasa, this Muslim holiday marks the end of Ramadan, the month of 
fasting. Families come together for prayers, and homes are opened to friends and family in a 
custom called “open houses,” where traditional dishes like rendang and ketupat are shared. The day 
represents renewal, forgiveness, and giving, with Muslims also fulfilling their zakat, or charity, 
obligations to support those in need.

Vesak Day  
Celebrated by Buddhists, Vesak Day honors the birth, enlightenment, and passing of Buddha. Temples 
are filled with devotees performing acts of charity, meditation, and prayers. Rituals include the 
“Bathing of the Buddha” ceremony, symbolizing purification and renewal. Many Buddhists also 
release caged birds or animals, representing compassion and the belief in the sanctity of life.

Hari Raya Haji (Eid al-Adha)  
Known globally as Eid al-Adha, Hari Raya Haji is celebrated by Muslims with communal prayers and 
the ritual sacrifice of livestock, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son in 
obedience to God. Families share the meat with relatives and distribute portions to the less 
fortunate, reinforcing the values of charity, faith, and sacrifice.

Deepavali (Diwali)  
Also known as the festival of lights, Deepavali celebrates the victory of light over darkness, 
good over evil. Hindu families decorate their homes with lamps and rangoli (colorful floor art) to 
welcome blessings. The day is marked by temple visits, family gatherings, and traditional Indian 
sweets, signifying prosperity, joy, and the renewal of hope.

### Does Singapore have a lot of public holidays compared to other countries?

When ranked globally, Singapore falls around the mid-range in terms of public holidays. The 11 
public holidays observed in Singapore are moderate compared to other countries in Asia and beyond. 
For instance:

+ High Holiday Countries: India tops the list with around 21-30 holidays per year, varying by state. Cambodia has 28 official holidays, and Thailand has around 19, making them some of the highest in Asia.  
+ Similar Holiday Counts: Other countries with similar holiday counts to Singapore include China 
with 11 public holidays and Malaysia with 14-16, though the latter varies regionally.  
+ Lower Holiday Counts: In contrast, the United States and Canada have around 10 federal holidays, 
while Australia has about 10-12, depending on the state.

Singapore has fewer public holidays primarily to maintain economic productivity and efficiency. 
The government aims to keep businesses and services running smoothly while allowing for enough 
time off to recognize key cultural and religious observances. With 11 public holidays, Singapore 
balances the need for operational continuity with the desire to provide citizens with adequate 
time for rest and celebration. This approach helps position Singapore as a competitive, 
business-friendly hub in the global economy, reducing potential disruptions in the workplace while 
still allowing for important cultural recognition.
