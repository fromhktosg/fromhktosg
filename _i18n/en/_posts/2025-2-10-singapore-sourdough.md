### What is sourdough?

Sourdough is a type of naturally leavened bread made through a fermentation process that uses wild yeast and lactobacilli, giving it a distinctive tangy flavor and chewy texture. Unlike store-bought bread, which relies on commercial yeast, sourdough is made with a starter—a mixture of flour and water that ferments over time. This process creates a complex flavor profile and makes sourdough a healthier option, as the fermentation breaks down gluten and increases the bread’s digestibility. In Singapore, sourdough has become a popular choice in cafes and artisanal bakeries, with locals seeking out the best sourdough bread in the city. Whether you’re craving a rustic sourdough loaf or the ever-popular sourdough toast, it’s clear that this timeless bread has found a new home in Singapore's food scene.

### Who started the sourdough craze?

The sourdough craze took off during the pandemic as home bakers embraced this artisanal bread trend, turning to sourdough starter recipes and fermentation tutorials. With viral social media posts and baking influencers sharing their creations, sourdough quickly became a global food phenomenon. The rise of sourdough bread was further fueled by celebrity chefs and food bloggers, making it one of the most popular bread types for home bakers and enthusiasts worldwide.

### How did the sourdough craze enter Singapore?

In Singapore, the sourdough trend gained popularity as locals sought healthier, artisanal bread options and embraced natural fermentation processes. Singapore's café culture and food scene, known for welcoming global food trends, saw an explosion of sourdough bread offerings in bakeries and restaurants.

### How do you make your own sourdough?

Making your own sourdough at home is a rewarding, albeit patient process. Here’s a simple guide to get you started on your sourdough baking journey:

<u>Ingredients<u>

For the starter:

+ 100g all-purpose flour (or whole wheat flour for a stronger starter)
+ 100g water (filtered or non-chlorinated)

For the dough:
+ 200g active sourdough starter
+ 375g all-purpose flour (or a mix of bread flour for chewier texture)
+ 250g water (room temperature)
+ 10g salt

1. Get a Sourdough Starter

The best way to get a reliable sourdough starter is to message an existing bakery for a portion of theirs. Many artisanal bakeries are happy to share a bit of their sourdough starter, which has been nurtured over time for perfect fermentation. If you prefer to create your own, mix equal parts of flour and water (typically 100g each) in a clean jar. Stir until combined, then cover loosely with a cloth. Let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours, then feed it with more flour and water daily for about 5-7 days, until it becomes bubbly and has a tangy smell.

2. Mix the Dough

Once your sourdough starter is active, mix it with flour, water, and salt to form your dough. A common ratio is 1 part starter to 3 parts flour. Knead the dough until it’s smooth and elastic, then let it rise for several hours at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge for a slower fermentation process.

3. Shape the Dough

Once the dough has doubled in size, gently deflate it and shape it into a round or oblong loaf. Allow it to rest for another few hours until it’s fully proofed and ready for baking.

4. Bake the Bread

Preheat your oven with a Dutch oven or baking stone inside to about 250°C. Once the oven is hot, score the top of your dough with a sharp knife or razor blade, then bake it with the lid on for 20 minutes. After removing the lid, bake for another 20-30 minutes until the crust is golden and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

5. Cool and Enjoy

Allow your sourdough bread to cool on a wire rack before slicing. This step is key for the best sourdough texture and flavor. Enjoy your homemade sourdough bread, perfect for sandwiches or as a side to any meal!
