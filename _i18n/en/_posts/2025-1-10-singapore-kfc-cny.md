When it comes to celebrating Chinese New Year in Singapore, one might not immediately think of fried chicken, but KFC has managed to make itself a surprising staple in the festivities. After a year filled with quirky burger experiments (because who doesn’t want to try something like a shrimp paste chicken burger?), it’s time to see if the Colonel can impress during the most significant holiday of the year. From limited-edition menu items to the ever-persistent question of why anyone eats fast food for CNY, let’s take a closer look at KFC’s 2025 offerings—and perhaps some alternatives if you’re feeling rebellious.

### How Has KFC in Singapore Been the Past Year?

KFC Singapore has had a year filled with ups, downs, and some bold experiments in the fast-food landscape. While its signature fried chicken remains a favorite, the chain faced fierce competition from other quick-service restaurants, each trying to carve out its niche in a saturated market. Customer feedback on service and quality was a mixed bag—some applauded the consistency, while others pointed out issues like long wait times during peak hours and occasional lapses in food quality. Nevertheless, KFC Singapore managed to stay in the spotlight, thanks in part to its unique and sometimes polarizing menu innovations that catered to adventurous eaters. These creative offerings showcased KFC's commitment to keeping things fresh (even if that meant taking a few risks along the way).

### KFC’s Unique Burger Offerings in 2024 (Non-CNY)

KFC Singapore isn’t shy about experimenting, and 2024 was no exception. Among its lineup of unique burger creations, the Shrimp Paste Chicken Burger stood out, blending local flavors with a fast-food twist. This salty, umami-packed option aimed to appeal to Singaporeans' love for classic zi char-inspired dishes but left some wondering if the fusion went a step too far. Then there was the Mac ‘n’ Cheese Zinger Burger, which combined crispy chicken with a gooey, cheesy center—perfect for indulgent eaters, though critics claimed it was a calorie bomb with little finesse.

Another standout was the Sambal Double Down, a fiery variation of their bun-less burger that paired spicy sambal sauce with two crispy chicken fillets as "buns." This offering was a bold nod to Singapore’s love for spice, earning praise from heat enthusiasts but deterring milder palates. While not every burger was a hit, these creations reflected KFC's ambition to push boundaries and give customers more reasons to keep coming back, whether out of curiosity or genuine enjoyment.

Priced at $4.95 and $5.45 respectively, these crispy, golden chicken skins offer a snackable option that satisfies those with a taste for crunch.
