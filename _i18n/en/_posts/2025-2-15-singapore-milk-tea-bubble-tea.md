### How did the bubble tea craze start?

The bubble tea craze began in Taiwan during the 1980s, with the invention of the now-famous drink made from tea, milk, and chewy tapioca pearls. Legend has it that Lin Hsiu Hui, the owner of a small tea shop, decided to add tapioca pearls to her iced tea, creating a unique combination that quickly gained popularity. By the 1990s, bubble tea made its way to other parts of Asia, including Singapore, where it rapidly became a hit. The trend was fueled by its novelty, customizable nature, and the fun of slurping up chewy pearls with every sip. Over time, social media amplified the craze, making bubble tea a global sensation that continues to thrive today.

Bubble tea made its way into Singapore in the early 1990s, shortly after it gained popularity in Taiwan. The first shops offering the trendy drink started popping up, initially catering to the younger crowd who were curious about the novelty of combining tea with chewy tapioca pearls. Singapore’s food scene, already known for embracing new trends, quickly embraced bubble tea, with local adaptations of flavors and toppings. The growing influence of Taiwanese pop culture, along with the rise of malls and food courts, created the perfect environment for bubble tea chains to expand rapidly. Soon, it wasn’t just a passing fad but a lasting part of Singapore's daily life, with local and international brands competing for the top spot in a fiercely popular market. Allegedly, Koi came first to SG. 

### Is it boba or bubble tea?

Whether it's called boba or bubble tea often depends on where you're from, but both terms refer to the same popular drink. Bubble tea is the more common name in places like Singapore and the U.S., highlighting the tea base and the chewy "bubbles" or pearls that sit at the bottom of the drink. On the other hand, boba is the term used primarily in Taiwan, where the drink originated, and it's often used interchangeably to describe the drink and the tapioca pearls themselves. So, if you're craving that sweet, chewy, Instagram-worthy drink, you can call it whatever you like—whether you're enjoying a boba milk tea or a bubble tea with pearls, you're in for a treat.

### What are the pearls or bubbles made of for bubble tea?

The pearls or bubbles in bubble tea are typically made from tapioca starch, water, and sugar, which are cooked to create chewy, translucent balls. Some variations may use other ingredients like agar or fruit juices for different textures and flavors.

### Is bubble tea healthy?

Bubble tea can be high in sugar and calories, especially with added toppings like tapioca pearls or cheese foam. While it provides some antioxidants from the tea, regular consumption may not be the healthiest choice due to its sugar content. Opting for lower sugar versions or healthier toppings can make it a more balanced treat.
