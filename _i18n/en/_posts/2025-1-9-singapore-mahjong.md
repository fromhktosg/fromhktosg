In Singapore, mahjong isn’t just a game—it’s practically a national sport, complete with fierce aunties, clinking tiles, and the occasional side-eye when someone takes too long to discard. Whether you're a seasoned player calculating fan points like a Wall Street trader or a newbie who thinks “pong” is just a sound effect, mahjong has a way of pulling people in. In this article, we’ll explore the history of mahjong, why it’s so addictive, where to play in Singapore, and most importantly, where to buy a set so you can host your own game nights and pretend you actually know the rules.

### What is Mahjong?

Mahjong is a tile-based game that originated in China and has become a beloved pastime in Singapore and many parts of Asia. Played with a set of 144 intricately designed tiles, the game is typically enjoyed by four players who aim to form winning combinations through strategy, skill, and a touch of luck. Combining elements of rummy and poker, mahjong requires sharp observation, quick thinking, and an ability to read opponents' moves. While the gameplay can seem intimidating to beginners, its mix of chance and strategy keeps both casual and competitive players coming back for more.

### History of Mahjong

Mahjong traces its roots back to the Qing Dynasty in China, with some historians believing it was developed as early as the mid-1800s. Originally played among the Chinese elite, it quickly gained popularity and spread across Asia and beyond, adapting to regional preferences along the way. During the early 20th century, mahjong reached Western countries, marketed as an exotic and intellectual game, and experienced a surge in popularity during the 1920s. In Singapore, mahjong has been deeply ingrained in the local culture, often played during festive seasons like Chinese New Year, symbolizing prosperity and good fortune. Over time, different variations emerged—Japanese Riichi, Cantonese-style, and the Singaporean version—each with its own rules and scoring systems, reflecting the game's adaptability and enduring appeal.

### Rules of Singapore Mahjong

Singapore Mahjong is a localized variation of Mahjong, sharing similarities with the Cantonese (Hong Kong) style but with its own unique twists. Here's a simplified overview of the rules:

1. Objective
The goal is to complete a winning hand consisting of 14 tiles by forming valid combinations (Pongs, Chows, Kongs) and a pair, then declaring "Hu" (win).

2. Setup
Tiles: 144 tiles including circles, bamboos, characters, winds, dragons, and flowers (extra joker tiles unique to Singapore Mahjong).
Players: 4 players, seated around a square table.
Dice Roll: Determines the dealer and starting position.

3. Gameplay
Dealing: Each player is dealt 13 tiles (14 for the dealer). Remaining tiles form the wall.
Turns: Players take turns drawing a tile and discarding one. The game proceeds clockwise.
Combos: Valid sets include:
Pong: Three identical tiles.
Chow: A sequence of three consecutive tiles from the same suit.
Kong: Four identical tiles (requires drawing a replacement tile from the dead wall).
Winning: To win, a player needs a hand of 4 sets and 1 pair (2 identical tiles).

4. Special Features in Singapore Mahjong
Animal and Flower Tiles:
Flowers (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, bamboo) and Seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter) earn bonus points when drawn.
Animal tiles (unique to Singapore Mahjong) also grant bonus points (cat, rat, rooster, worm).
Joker Tiles: Wildcards that can substitute any tile to complete a set, but only one joker is allowed in a winning hand.
Scoring Bonuses: Additional points for specific combinations like "Seven Pairs" (seven pairs of matching tiles) or "Full Flush" (all tiles from one suit).

5. Winning and Scoring
When a player completes their hand and declares "Hu," scoring is calculated based on the combinations, bonuses, and flower/animal tiles.
Penalties apply for invalid declarations or specific rule violations.

6. End of the Game
The round ends when someone wins or when all tiles from the wall are drawn without a winner ("draw").
The dealer changes after each round unless the dealer wins.
