If you've ever walked past a Don Don Donki in Singapore and didn't hear its jingle looping endlessly, were you even there?

This Japanese discount chain has taken Singapore by storm, stuffing its stores with everything from groceries to premium strawberries to bizarre beauty gadgets you never knew you needed. Since opening its first store here in 2017, Don Don Donki has expanded aggressively, because apparently, we can’t get enough of Japanese snacks and household randomness. With locations scattered across the island (yes, even in heartland malls now), it’s almost too easy to fall into the trap of “just browsing” and leaving with a bag full of Hokkaido milk and mochi. And let’s not forget the iconic theme song—composed to burrow into your brain forever—because nothing says “welcome to our store” like a never-ending loop of “Don Don Don, Donki~.”. One of my favourite [grocery chains](https://fromhktosg.github.io/grocery/)!

### What is Don don don ki (DDDK)?

Don Don Donki, also known as Donki, Don Donki, Don Ki Don Ki, Don Don Ki, or DDDK, is a Japanese discount store chain that sells a dizzying variety of products, from fresh produce to quirky household items. Originally called Don Quijote in Japan, the brand is famous for its tightly packed aisles, bright neon signs, and an inescapable jingle that somehow makes shopping feel like an adventure. Unlike your typical supermarket, Don Don Donki specializes in Japanese goods, making it the go-to spot for fans. Whether you're after premium Japanese ingredients or just need a last-minute souvenir that screams kawaii, Don Don Donki probably has it—somewhere in the maze of its shelves. Just be prepared to leave with more than you planned, because resisting a good Japanese snack haul is nearly impossible.

### History of DDDK in Singapore

### Who composed the DDDK song and why is it so catchy?

+ Composer: The Don Don Donki theme song (also known as the “Miracle Shopping” song) was composed by Takahiro Yamato, a Japanese musician and producer.
+ Original Purpose: The song was originally created for Don Quijote Japan in 1999 as a fun, energetic jingle to enhance the shopping experience.

Catchiness Factor:
+ Repetitive lyrics – The words “Don Don Don, Donki~” are impossible to forget after hearing them a few times.
+ Upbeat melody – The song’s high-energy, fast-paced rhythm keeps customers engaged.
+ Psychological influence – The tune is designed to create a sense of excitement and urgency, encouraging shoppers to stay longer and buy more.
+ Singapore's Love for It: Just like bubble tea, the song is annoyingly addictive, and most Singaporeans probably hum it in their heads even when they don’t want to.

### What products can you buy in DDDK?

My go-tos

+ Niigata Rice – Premium, aromatic rice from Japan’s Niigata prefecture, known for its soft texture and superior taste.
+ Pork Jowl – Tender, flavorful cuts of pork with a good balance of meat and fat, perfect for grilling or hotpot.
+ Beef Shabu Frozen – Thinly sliced beef ideal for shabu-shabu, a Japanese hotpot dish, offering a melt-in-your-mouth experience.
+ Unsweetened Soy Milk – A creamy, plant-based milk option with no added sugars, great for cooking or drinking.
+ Sanuki Udon – Thick, chewy Japanese noodles from the Kagawa region, perfect for a comforting bowl of udon soup.
+ Spring Onion – Fresh and vibrant, these add a burst of flavor and crunch to any dish, especially in stir-fries or soups. Tastes different from the spring onion coming from Malaysia
+ Mizkan Nabe Soup Base – A ready-to-use broth base for hotpot, delivering authentic Japanese flavors with ease.
+ Frozen Meatballs – Convenient and versatile, these frozen meatballs are perfect for quick meals like soups or skewers.

My go-tos

Avoid:
+ Fried Foods – Like fried chicken or tempura (unless you’re in the mood for extra grease).
