It seems like the weather in Singapore can't decide if it's sunny or monsoon season – but that's just another day in the tropical paradise, right? In this article, we'll dive into the frequent rain, why it feels like we live in a sauna, and how to keep track of the forecast without consulting a crystal ball. Meanwhile, we'll take a peek at global weather chaos, from wildfires in LA to what the future holds for both Singapore's unpredictable skies and the planet's increasingly bizarre climate.

### Why is it raining so much in Singapore?

In the second week of January 2025, Singapore experienced increased rainfall due to prevailing Northeast Monsoon conditions. The Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) reported that moderate to heavy thundery showers were expected on most afternoons, with some extending into the night. This period is typically wetter, with the first fortnight of January forecasted to have above-average rainfall across most parts of the island.

Additionally, a strengthening of high-pressure systems over the northern Asian continent can lead to a monsoon surge, bringing stronger north-easterly winds and wetter conditions to Singapore. Such surges can result in increased rainfall during this period.

These weather patterns are consistent with Singapore's typical climate during the Northeast Monsoon season, which spans from December to early March. During this time, the region often experiences increased rainfall and cooler temperatures.

### Is this rainy weather expected to persist?

The rainy weather in Singapore is expected to persist. January falls within the Northeast Monsoon season, which typically brings frequent showers, particularly in the first half of the month. According to the Meteorological Service Singapore, the rainfall is expected to remain above average, with moderate to heavy showers, especially in the afternoon and evening. This rainy pattern usually continues through the monsoon period, which lasts until March. So, you can expect more wet weather for the next few weeks.

### What’s happening with the world’s weather?

<u>The World’s Weather: A Glimpse Into the Chaos<u>

As we move further into the 21st century, the world’s weather has become increasingly erratic, unpredictable, and intense. From scorching wildfires to devastating floods, extreme weather events have become more frequent, and the global climate is shifting in ways that were once unimaginable. The connection between human activities and the changing climate has never been clearer, with a growing number of scientists and experts pointing to the urgent need for action. But what exactly is happening with the world's weather, and what does the future hold?

<u>Climate Change and Rising Temperatures<u>

One of the most significant contributors to the increasingly chaotic weather patterns is climate change, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Since the late 19th century, global temperatures have risen significantly, with the past few decades showing an accelerated rate of warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that the Earth's average temperature has increased by approximately 1.2°C since pre-industrial times, with the last decade being the hottest on record.

The warming of the planet is influencing weather patterns in numerous ways. One of the most noticeable impacts is the rise in extreme heatwaves. In recent years, cities across the globe have been experiencing record-breaking temperatures, with places like Siberia recording temperatures 18°C higher than the historical average. These heatwaves not only make life unbearable but also worsen the intensity of wildfires and droughts. Regions like California, Australia, and parts of Southern Europe have suffered devastating fires fueled by high temperatures and dry conditions, with entire forests and communities destroyed in mere hours.

<u>Unprecedented Floods and Hurricanes<u>
While some parts of the world are grappling with extreme heat, others are experiencing an increase in heavy rainfall and flooding. Rising temperatures have caused more moisture to evaporate from the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to heavier and more intense rainfall in some areas. This has resulted in severe flooding in regions like South Asia, East Africa, and even parts of Europe.

In 2024, for example, Libya witnessed catastrophic flooding that resulted in the deaths of thousands of people. Similarly, Bangladesh and parts of India face annual monsoons that often lead to displacement and destruction of infrastructure. The increased frequency and intensity of such rainfall events are linked to the overall rise in global temperatures and the changing patterns of atmospheric circulation.

Moreover, hurricane and typhoon seasons have become more intense. In 2024, the Atlantic hurricane season brought some of the most powerful storms to date, with Hurricane Dorian and Hurricane Ida causing widespread destruction in the Caribbean and the U.S. The Pacific Ocean also saw powerful typhoons that wreaked havoc on the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations. These storms, fueled by higher ocean temperatures, are becoming stronger, faster, and more unpredictable, leaving millions vulnerable to their wrath.

<u>The Melting of the Polar Regions<u>

The polar regions are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, and what happens here has a ripple effect on global weather patterns. The Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. As the ice melts, it reduces the Earth’s ability to reflect sunlight, causing more heat to be absorbed by the ocean and land, which accelerates warming.

This loss of ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic is not just an environmental concern—it's a matter of global stability. As ice sheets melt, the sea levels rise, threatening low-lying coastal cities like Miami, New York, Mumbai, and Venice. In addition to melting ice, the loss of permafrost in the Arctic is releasing vast amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which further accelerates the climate crisis.

<u>Droughts and Desertification<u>

Along with increased rainfall in some parts of the world, other regions are experiencing severe droughts. Areas that are already arid are becoming even more dry, which leads to desertification—the process by which fertile land becomes desert. Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia are particularly vulnerable to drought conditions, with agriculture and water supply systems being heavily impacted.

In places like California and Southwestern United States, extended periods of drought are straining water resources, damaging crops, and leading to conflicts over water access. In some areas, the worsening of drought conditions has triggered migration, as people seek more habitable environments. These droughts, compounded by the demands of urbanization and industrial growth, create a perfect storm of environmental and social instability.

<u>A Global Response to Extreme Weather<u>

While the weather itself is becoming more extreme and chaotic, the global response to these shifts is still lacking. Many governments have failed to adequately address the root causes of climate change, despite growing calls for urgent action. However, there are efforts underway to mitigate the damage.

International agreements such as the Paris Agreement aim to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, but achieving this goal requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Countries like China, the United States, and the European Union are working on policies to transition toward renewable energy, implement carbon pricing, and invest in green technologies. Additionally, efforts to adapt to the changing climate, such as building more resilient infrastructure and improving disaster preparedness, are gaining traction.

Yet, these actions must be taken on a much larger scale, with international cooperation being key to addressing the global nature of the problem. Furthermore, nations must confront the reality of climate justice, ensuring that developing countries, which are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts, are provided the support they need to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

<u>Looking Ahead: What the Future Holds<u>

The future of the world’s weather is uncertain. Without significant reductions in emissions and changes in human behavior, the planet could experience even more extreme weather events in the coming decades. Rising sea levels, more frequent wildfires, intense storms, and prolonged droughts will likely become the new normal for many parts of the world. However, it’s not all doom and gloom—there is still a chance to reverse some of the damage if global leaders take immediate and decisive action.

Individuals also have a role to play. By making sustainable choices, reducing carbon footprints, and advocating for policy changes, people everywhere can contribute to efforts to stabilize the climate. The question is not whether the weather will continue to get more extreme, but whether humanity will act quickly enough to minimize the damage and protect future generations from a planet in chaos.

In conclusion, the world’s weather is in turmoil, and climate change is the driving force behind many of these unpredictable and extreme events. Whether it’s scorching heatwaves, deadly floods, or melting ice caps, the impact of human activity on the environment has never been clearer. As we move forward, the question remains: can we adapt and mitigate the damage before it’s too late? The answer lies in global cooperation, sustainable living, and the determination to act now.

### What happened in the LA fires 2025?

In early January 2025, Los Angeles experienced unprecedented wildfires that devastated large portions of the city. The Palisades Fire, which ignited near the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, rapidly expanded to encompass 5,000 acres. Strong winds caused the fire to grow by "three football fields of land per minute," prompting mandatory evacuations along sections of the Pacific Coast Highway and surrounding areas. The fire's swift progression was fueled by a combination of dry conditions, high temperatures, and an ongoing drought in the region. Climate change, which has exacerbated these conditions, is a key factor in the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires. The fire led to the destruction of over 5,000 homes and the loss of at least 10 lives.

In addition to the Palisades Fire, other significant fires, including the Kenneth Fire in West Hills and the Eaton Fire in Altadena, contributed to the widespread devastation. Collectively, these fires burned more than 15,000 acres, leading to the evacuation of over 180,000 residents. The fires’ rapid spread was exacerbated by strong Santa Ana winds, which further dried out vegetation and helped fuel the flames. These winds are a seasonal feature in Southern California, but in recent years, they have become more intense and frequent, partly due to climate shifts. The ongoing drought, worsened by rising global temperatures, left the vegetation in the area highly susceptible to ignition, turning what could have been manageable fires into catastrophic blazes.

The economic impact of the wildfires is estimated to be up to $150 billion, underscoring the severe impact on the community and infrastructure. Famous landmarks and homes of celebrities such as John Goodman, Leighton Meester, Paris Hilton, and Anthony Hopkins have been destroyed. Despite the profound devastation, residents have shown resilience, highlighting community strength and the determination to rebuild. However, these fires are a stark reminder of the growing risk posed by climate change and its role in worsening fire conditions. As temperatures continue to rise, experts predict that such fires will become more frequent and more severe, unless urgent action is taken to address the underlying climate crisis.

### What can we expect from future Singapore weather?

In the future, temperatures in Singapore could rise significantly due to global warming and climate change. Singapore’s current average annual temperature is around 27°C, but projections suggest that temperatures could rise by 1.5°C to 3°C by the end of the century if global emissions continue at their current pace. This means that in the coming decades, Singapore could see average temperatures reaching up to 30°C or higher during the day, with nighttime temperatures also rising.

During heatwaves, temperatures in urban areas could soar even higher due to the urban heat island effect, where concrete and other infrastructure absorb and retain heat. This could push temperatures to exceed 35°C on particularly hot days, creating uncomfortable and potentially hazardous living conditions. In extreme cases, daily highs could occasionally reach 37°C or even higher. This kind of temperature rise would not only affect human health and well-being, increasing the risks of heat stress and heatstroke, but also place greater pressure on air conditioning systems and energy demand.

Higher temperatures are also likely to lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms and thunderstorms, as warmer air holds more moisture, potentially leading to more intense rainfall. These rising temperatures, combined with the effects of global climate change, will make it essential for Singapore to focus on climate adaptation strategies, such as increasing green spaces, improving cooling systems, and ensuring urban infrastructure is resilient to higher temperatures

### What can we expect from future global weather?

Future global weather is expected to be characterized by more frequent and extreme events as the planet continues to warm due to climate change. The Earth’s average temperature is projected to rise by 1.5°C to 3°C by the end of the century, which will significantly impact weather patterns across the globe. Below are key changes we can expect in global weather:
More Extreme Heatwaves: As temperatures rise, regions around the world will experience more intense and prolonged heatwaves. These extreme temperatures will become more frequent, particularly in regions that are already hot, such as parts of the Middle East, South Asia, and Southern Europe. Cities will experience higher urban heat island effects, leading to even hotter conditions. Prolonged heatwaves will put stress on infrastructure, healthcare systems, and agriculture, while increasing risks of wildfires and droughts.

Intensified Storms and Hurricanes: Warmer ocean temperatures will lead to stronger and more destructive hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones. These storms will likely increase in frequency and intensity, with greater rainfall, storm surges, and destructive winds. Coastal areas will be especially vulnerable to flooding and infrastructure damage, while regions prone to cyclones will face greater risks of destruction. The Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Gulf Coast of the United States are likely to be impacted most severely.

Rising Sea Levels and Coastal Flooding: As polar ice melts and glaciers retreat, sea levels are expected to rise by up to one meter or more by 2100. This will lead to coastal flooding and the erosion of coastlines, particularly in low-lying islands and cities. Areas such as Venice, Miami, and Bangladesh face the risk of permanent inundation, displacing millions of people and disrupting ecosystems. In addition to flooding, more frequent storm surges will exacerbate the impact of rising seas.

Unpredictable Rainfall and Droughts: Many regions will experience more extreme rainfall events, leading to flooding and damage to infrastructure, crops, and ecosystems. At the same time, some areas will face extended droughts due to shifting atmospheric patterns. This imbalance will create challenges for agriculture and water supply, particularly in parts of Africa, Australia, and the western United States, where droughts are becoming more frequent.

Disrupted Ecosystems and Biodiversity Loss: Climate change will significantly impact global ecosystems, with some areas becoming uninhabitable for species that are not able to adapt to the changing conditions. Forests, coral reefs, and wetlands will be particularly vulnerable to shifts in temperature, precipitation, and storm activity. The loss of biodiversity will affect global food security, as well as disrupt natural services such as pollination and water purification.

Increased Migration and Conflict: As weather extremes become more common, migration due to climate-related factors like drought, flooding, and extreme heat is expected to increase. People from regions most affected by climate change may be forced to move to safer areas, placing strain on urban infrastructure and resources. This may lead to climate-induced conflict as competition for resources like water and arable land intensifies.

In conclusion, the future of global weather will be marked by more extreme events, including heatwaves, storms, flooding, droughts, and rising seas. The impact of climate change will affect every corner of the globe, challenging governments, communities, and ecosystems to adapt and mitigate the damage. To prevent the worst outcomes, urgent action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in sustainable practices is essential to limit further global temperature increases.
