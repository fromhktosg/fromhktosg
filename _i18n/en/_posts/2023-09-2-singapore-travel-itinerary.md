Apologies for the gaps in posts - things have been hectic over the last month, and with the introduction of our Chinese language posts, I simply haven't had the time to post new content. However, we are now back!

A few of my friends have been visiting Singapore and have asked me to create an itinerary for them. Many ask whether there are things to do in Singapore. The answer is yes and no. Singapore is a small but mighty city-state that offers a world of experiences within its compact borders. Despite its size, this dynamic metropolis is packed with iconic landmarks, cultural enclaves, stunning gardens, delectable cuisine, and much more. Overall, I recommend 3 days as the optimal amount of time to spend in Singapore. Anything more and you’ll be struggling to find things to do. Here's the itinerary below. Note - we’ll save a more in-depth restaurant / bars guide for another time.

#### Day 1:

<u>Morning<u>
+ Breakfast at Ya Kun: Start your Singapore adventure with a hearty breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya Toast, a local favorite known for its traditional Singaporean breakfast. Indulge in crispy toast slathered with kaya (coconut jam) and paired with soft-boiled eggs and a cup of aromatic kopi (local coffee). Ya Kun’s are everywhere so it’s not hard to find. Alternatively, visiting Toast Box is ok too.
+ Chinatown: After breakfast, make your way to Chinatown, a vibrant district teeming with colorful shophouses, bustling markets, and rich cultural heritage. Take a leisurely stroll along the vibrant streets, visit the historic Sri Mariamman Temple, and savor delicious local street food at the Chinatown Food Street.

<u>Afternoon<u>
+ Tiong Bahru: Afterward, make your way to Tiong Bahru, a hip neighborhood known for its trendy cafes and charming heritage buildings. Enjoy a leisurely dinner at one of the local eateries, and explore the neighborhood's unique boutiques and art galleries. Alternatively, check out the large Tiong Bahru Hawker center market for a local lunch, including Char Kway Teow, Chicken rice and Bak Chor Mee
+ Artscience museum: Head to the ArtScience Museum, located within the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex. Explore the museum's interactive exhibits that blend art, science, and technology, offering a unique and immersive experience.

<u>Evening<u>

Enjoy panoramic views of the city skyline and the dazzling light show that illuminates the night sky. At night, head to Gardens by the Bay, a stunning nature park that boasts iconic Supertrees and beautiful flower domes. Explore the various themed gardens and check out the free Garden Rhapsody performance.

+ Sentosa: Head to Sentosa Island, a popular resort island with a myriad of attractions. Spend the afternoon enjoying the sandy beaches, visiting Universal Studios Singapore for thrilling rides and entertainment, or exploring the S.E.A. Aquarium for an underwater adventure. On the way out of Sentosa, check out Vivo City. Plenty to shop at that mall

<u>Evening<u>
+ Clarke Quay: Take the MRT from Harborfront (Vivo City) to Clarke Quay. Enjoy a leisurely dinner at one of the many riverside restaurants offering a variety of cuisines. My recommendation is the Song Fa Ba Ku Teh there, a restaurant renowned for its flavorful pork rib soup. If you’re a party person, plenty of clubs / bars here, including the infamous Zouk

#### Day 3:

+ Little India: Start your day with a visit to Little India, a vibrant cultural enclave filled with colorful shops, aromatic spice stalls, and traditional Indian eateries. Immerse yourself in the vibrant atmosphere, visit Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, and savor authentic Indian cuisine for breakfast. MTR is a great restaurant here

FWIW, there’s a Dover Street Market there too
