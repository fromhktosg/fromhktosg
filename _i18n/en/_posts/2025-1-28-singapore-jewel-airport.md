Welcome to Singapore's Jewel Changi Airport, a revolutionary mall-airport hybrid featuring top attractions like the Rain Vortex waterfall, premium shops, acclaimed restaurants, and a unique floor plan that rivals other shopping destinations in Singapore.

While most airports are content with basic amenities like places to sit and wait for your flight, Jewel decided to go full Singapore-style extra with an indoor forest, countless shopping options, and enough restaurants to make you consider intentionally missing your connection. Beyond just being a mall with a fancy water feature, this glass-domed marvel actually houses some genuinely impressive attractions that'll have you planning future layovers in Singapore (yes, really), though there are plenty of alternative malls if you somehow get bored of watching water fall from the sky inside a building.

### Special hacks to Jewel

Here are a few of my secrets - 

+ Skip the tourist crowds by visiting the Rain Vortex before 11 AM or after 9 PM, when the lighting makes the waterfall somehow even more dramatic and your Instagram photos won't be photobombed by a hundred other smartphones.
+ Early birds can take advantage of the early check-in counters up to 24 hours before your flight – drop off your luggage, grab your boarding pass, and enjoy a baggage-free shopping spree without that awkward roller suitcase bumping into everything.
+ For those who appreciate a touch of luxury (without the luxury price tag), the Changi Lounge in Jewel offers pay-per-use access with showers, nap pods, and buffet spreads – perfect for refreshing between shopping sessions or when you're pretending your flight isn't delayed.
+ If you're visiting during Singapore's notorious rain showers, use the air-conditioned link bridges from terminals 1, 2, or 3 to reach Jewel – you'll stay dry and get some bonus plane-spotting opportunities along the way.
+ Save money on airport food by heading to the basement level's Food Hall, where you'll find local favorites at much more reasonable prices than the fancy restaurants upstairs (though you might still need to take out a small loan for that famous pepper crab).
