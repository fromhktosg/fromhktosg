When it comes to earthquakes, Singapore is like that one friend who never shows up to the drama but somehow hears all about it. Nestled safely on a geologically stable plate, the Lion City doesn’t experience earthquakes directly—though the occasional tremor makes us check if we’ve been too ambitious with those rooftop pools. Yet, we still get earthquake warnings, thanks to our neighbors who, quite literally, live on the edge of tectonic action.

### Does Singapore have earthquakes?

Singapore doesn’t have earthquakes, and it’s not because we’re special—it’s all about location. The country sits comfortably on the Eurasian tectonic plate, far from any active fault lines where most earthquakes originate. This geological stability ensures we avoid the ground-shaking chaos that our neighbors closer to the Pacific Ring of Fire experience.
Earthquakes occur when stress builds up along tectonic plate boundaries and is suddenly released, causing the ground to shake. These stress points—commonly found at convergent, divergent, or transform boundaries—are where plates grind, collide, or pull apart. Since Singapore is blissfully far from such volatile zones, the Earth beneath us stays calm, even as the surrounding region occasionally rocks and rolls.

### Why do we get earthquake warnings in Singapore?

Even though Singapore doesn’t experience earthquakes directly, we still get earthquake warnings because of our seismic neighbors. Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, which are perched on the Pacific Ring of Fire, frequently experience major quakes that send tremors rippling through the region. When these earthquakes are strong enough, their effects can sometimes be felt in high-rise buildings or coastal areas here, prompting local warnings and safety alerts. Essentially, we’re the quiet neighbor who hears the noise from the wild party next door.
Singapore’s earthquake warnings often come through notifications on apps like myENV, managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). These alerts inform residents about tremors detected in nearby regions, especially if there’s a chance we might feel some minor effects. It’s a quick, efficient way of letting us know that while we’re not in immediate danger, a regional quake has made its presence known.

### What to look out for when traveling abroad pertaining earthquakes

When traveling abroad to earthquake-prone regions, here are a few things to keep in mind:
+ Research the Region’s Seismic Activity: Check if your destination is located near active fault lines or in an earthquake-prone zone.
+ Learn Emergency Procedures: Familiarize yourself with local earthquake protocols, such as evacuation routes and safe shelters.
+ Know Your Accommodation’s Safety Features: Stay in buildings that are earthquake-resistant or meet local seismic safety standards.
+ Pack a Basic Emergency Kit: Include essentials like a flashlight, water, snacks, a whistle, and a phone charger.
+ Be Aware of Aftershock Risks: Even after a major quake, smaller tremors can occur—stay cautious and avoid unsafe structures.
+ Stay Informed: Use local apps or notifications to stay updated on seismic alerts while traveling.
+ Avoid Coastal Areas During Quakes: Earthquakes near the sea can trigger tsunamis, so know the nearest high ground.
+ Have a Communication Plan: Keep family and friends informed of your travel plans and ensure you have a way to contact them in emergencies.
+ Practice the Drop, Cover, and Hold Technique: In case of a quake, know how to protect yourself effectively.
+ Check Travel Insurance Policies: Ensure your insurance covers natural disasters like earthquakes.

### What countries do we see most number of earthquakes?

When it comes to earthquakes, some countries seem to get all the action. Starting close to Singapore, Indonesia tops the list, as it sits smack dab on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where several tectonic plates meet and grind. The Philippines isn’t far behind, with frequent quakes thanks to its position near the same volatile zone. Moving a bit further, Japan is infamous for its seismic activity, with advanced warning systems to handle frequent tremors.
Shifting focus to South Asia, Nepal and India experience significant earthquakes, especially in the Himalayan region, where the Indian plate collides with the Eurasian plate. Across the Pacific, countries like Chile and Mexico in Latin America also see intense earthquake activity due to their location along subduction zones. Finally, the west coast of the United States—particularly California—is known for its frequent quakes, thanks to the San Andreas Fault and other fault lines that make the region a geological hotbed.

### How are earthquakes and tsunamis related?

Earthquakes and tsunamis are closely linked, as underwater earthquakes are one of the primary causes of tsunamis. When a powerful earthquake occurs beneath the ocean floor, it can displace large amounts of water by causing the seabed to rise or fall suddenly. This displacement generates waves that travel across the ocean at high speeds, often unnoticed in deep water but growing taller and more destructive as they approach coastal areas.

The severity of a tsunami depends on factors like the magnitude of the earthquake, its depth, and the type of fault movement. Subduction zones, where one tectonic plate dives beneath another, are particularly notorious for triggering massive tsunamis. One devastating example near Singapore was the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, caused by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, which resulted in over 230,000 deaths across multiple countries. More recently, in 2018, the Palu tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia, followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, killing thousands and devastating coastal communities. These events highlight the destructive potential when earthquakes and tsunamis collide.

### What to do in an earthquake?

Here are the exact steps to take during an earthquake to stay safe:

1. Drop, Cover, and Hold On:

Drop to your hands and knees to prevent being knocked over.
Cover your head and neck with your arms or seek shelter under a sturdy table or desk.
Hold On to your shelter to keep it in place until the shaking stops.

2. Stay Indoors if You’re Inside:

Move away from windows, mirrors, glass, and anything that could shatter.
Avoid doorways unless you know they are strong and load-bearing.
Stay in place until the shaking stops; do not run outside as falling debris poses a high risk.

3. Stay Outside if You’re Outdoors:

Move to an open area away from buildings, streetlights, utility wires, and large trees.
Stay low to the ground and avoid unstable structures.

4. If You’re in a Car:

Pull over to a safe location, away from bridges, overpasses, and power lines.
Stay in the car until the shaking stops.

5. After the Shaking Stops:

Check yourself and others for injuries, and administer first aid if needed.
Be prepared for aftershocks, which can occur minutes or hours after the initial quake.
Avoid entering damaged buildings and stay alert for hazards like gas leaks, fires, or structural collapses.

6. If You’re Near the Coast:

Move to higher ground immediately if the earthquake is strong and lasts more than 20 seconds, as it could trigger a tsunami.

7. Stay Informed:

Listen to emergency broadcasts or use apps for updates on the situation.
Follow instructions from local authorities regarding evacuation or safety measures.

Always keep a small earthquake emergency kit. An earthquake emergency kit should include essentials like water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, a first-aid kit, a whistle, and a phone charger or power bank. Additional items like sturdy gloves, personal medications, important documents, and a radio can help you stay prepared for extended emergencies.

We’re lucky in Singapore but always be prepared when abroad in an earthquake-prone country!
