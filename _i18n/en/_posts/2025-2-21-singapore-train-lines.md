How often does the Singapore MRT arrive? More often than your Grab driver during surge pricing, and usually on time—unless there’s a track fault.

If you're looking for the latest Singapore MRT schedule, wondering about the Singapore MRT fare, or debating between the Singapore MRT vs bus, we’ve got you covered. We’ll also take a quick ride through Singapore MRT history, introduce you to every Singapore MRT line, highlight key stations, and even look at upcoming Singapore MRT lines. And if you’re curious about Singapore MRT payment methods, yes, you can tap in with your credit card or Apple Watch—because carrying a separate transit card is so last decade. Let’s dive in and make your Singapore train commute as smooth as possible.

### When does the Singapore MRT start and end?

The Singapore MRT generally starts running around 5:30 AM and operates until about midnight. On Fridays, Saturdays, and the eve of public holidays, some lines may run slightly later, usually until 12:30 AM. First and last train times vary by station and MRT line, so it’s always a good idea to check the TransitLink SimplyGo app or the official SMRT/LTA website for exact timings. If you miss the last train, your options are limited to night buses, Grab, or paying the price for a late-night taxi ride.

### How often does the Singapore MRT arrive?

The Singapore MRT typically arrives every 2 to 5 minutes during peak hours and 5 to 7 minutes during off-peak hours. Late at night or early in the morning, trains may run every 10 to 15 minutes. On weekends and public holidays, frequencies can vary slightly depending on the line and time of day. If you're traveling on less busy lines like the Thomson-East Coast Line, expect slightly longer wait times.

### How do I track for Singapore MRT arrival times?

You can always check real-time train arrival times on the TransitLink SimplyGo app or at MRT station screens.

### How much does the Singapore MRT cost?

The cost of taking the Singapore MRT depends on the distance you travel. Fares typically range from S$0.92 to S$2.17 for adults, with discounted fares for seniors, students, and people with disabilities. The fare is calculated based on the starting point and destination, with the price increasing for longer distances. 

### Can I pay with my own credit card or Apple Watch or do I need a Singapore MRT transit card?

Yes, you can pay for your Singapore MRT ride with your own credit card or Apple Watch—no need for a separate MRT transit card like the EZ-Link or NETS FlashPay. Thanks to the SimplyGo system, you can link your credit card or Apple Pay account and tap in and out directly at the MRT gates. This contactless payment method makes it super convenient, especially if you’re not a fan of carrying around extra cards. Just make sure your card or device is compatible with SimplyGo before you hop on.

### When was the Singapore MRT constructed?

The Singapore MRT was officially constructed in 1983, with the first line, the North-South Line (NSL), opening in 1987. This marked the beginning of Singapore's ambitious plan to create a world-class public transport system. The project was designed to reduce road congestion and provide an efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly mode of transportation for the growing city-state. Since then, the MRT network has expanded significantly, with new lines and extensions making it one of the most advanced urban rail systems in the world.

These new lines will further boost connectivity across Singapore, ensuring the MRT system continues to meet the needs of a growing, modern city.

### Should I take the MRT on the bus?

The question of whether you should take the MRT or the bus really depends on a few things: where you're going, how much time you have, and whether you’re in the mood for an adventure. If you're heading somewhere on the MRT, it’s usually the faster, more reliable option—especially during peak hours, when buses might get stuck in traffic. The MRT is direct, air-conditioned, and mostly on time, offering quicker connections to key spots across the city. On the other hand, if you're in no rush and prefer scenic views or if you're traveling somewhere without an MRT station nearby, the bus could be your better choice. Just keep in mind that buses can be a little more unpredictable, but hey, they come with a more personal touch—like making new friends during rush hour.
