Singapore is known for its efficiency, cleanliness, and—depending on who you ask—its unique take on social etiquette. But what exactly are manners and etiquette, and how do they differ?

While manners are more about general politeness and consideration for others, etiquette refers to the specific rules of social conduct, which can vary wildly across cultures. The classic East vs. West etiquette debate is especially relevant here—should you slurp your noodles (acceptable in Japan) or keep it silent (a faux pas in the West)? In this guide, we’ll break down good manners in Singapore, explore whether Singaporeans are truly as well-mannered as our city’s reputation suggests, and, most importantly, figure out how we can all be just a little more polite—preferably without a government campaign reminding us to.

### What are manners and etiquettes?

Manners and etiquette are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings—especially in a place like Singapore, where social behavior is a mix of Asian traditions and Western influences. Manners refer to the general principles of politeness, such as saying "thank you" or holding the door open, while etiquette is the specific set of rules that govern social interactions, like proper dining etiquette or how to greet someone formally. In Singapore, where cultural diversity shapes daily interactions, understanding the difference between manners and etiquette is key to navigating both casual and professional settings. Whether it’s knowing when to offer a handshake, whether to bow slightly, or when to remove your shoes before entering a home, both good manners and proper etiquette help maintain harmony in this fast-paced city. Mastering these social norms not only prevents awkward encounters but also ensures a smoother experience in Singapore’s highly structured society.

### How do manners and etiquettes differ between the East and the West?

1. Respect for Hierarchy vs. Individualism

In Asian cultures, including Singapore etiquette, respect for elders and authority figures is crucial—titles like "Uncle" or "Auntie" are commonly used.

In Western cultures, people are more likely to address others by their first name, even in professional settings.

2. Indirect vs. Direct Communication

Asian etiquette often involves indirect communication to maintain harmony—people may avoid saying "no" outright or use polite phrases to soften rejection.

In Western cultures, directness is valued, and saying "no" firmly is seen as honesty rather than rudeness.

3. Dining Etiquette Differences

In Singapore and much of Asia, table manners include sharing dishes, using chopsticks correctly, and not sticking them upright in rice (which resembles funeral rituals).

In the West, individual plates are the norm, and using utensils improperly (like resting elbows on the table) is considered impolite.

4. Gift-Giving Etiquette

In Singapore culture, gifts are often given with both hands as a sign of respect, and some items (like clocks or sharp objects) are avoided due to unlucky meanings.

Western gift-giving is more casual, with fewer taboos—people may open presents immediately rather than waiting for a later time.

5. Public Behavior and Personal Space

In Asia, public decorum is highly valued—talking loudly in public or public displays of affection (PDA) may be frowned upon, even in modern Singapore.

In Western societies, expressing emotions openly, whether through hugs or strong opinions, is more accepted as part of personal freedom.

### Is Singapore a well-mannered country?

Singapore is often praised for its clean streets, efficiency, and strict laws, but does that mean it’s a well-mannered country? In many ways, yes—Singapore etiquette emphasizes respect for elders, queueing in an orderly fashion, and maintaining cleanliness in public spaces (thanks in part to heavy fines). However, some argue that Singaporean manners could improve, especially when it comes to crowded MRT trains, loud phone conversations in public, and the occasional lack of "thank yous" to service staff. That said, this isn’t unique to Singapore—many fast-paced cities around the world, from Hong Kong to New York, have a similar mix of efficiency and occasional social indifference. With its multicultural blend of Asian and Western etiquette, Singapore maintains a unique balance—structured, efficient, and mostly well-behaved (as long as there's a sign reminding everyone to follow the rules).

### Specific Manners and Etiquette in Singapore

+ Queueing is Sacred

Whether at hawker centres, MRT stations, or bubble tea shops, Singaporeans take queueing seriously—cutting the line is a guaranteed way to earn some disapproving stares.

+ Returning Trays at Hawker Centres

The tray return policy in Singapore is now enforced, so diners are expected to clear their tables after eating. Not doing so isn’t just rude—it might get you a fine.

+ Speaking Softly in Public

Loud conversations on public transport or in cafés are frowned upon, though this rule seems to be forgotten when someone is on a speakerphone call.

+ Respecting Elders and Addressing People Properly

Using "Uncle" and "Auntie" to refer to older individuals (even if they’re not related to you) is common Singapore etiquette, especially when speaking to hawker stall owners or taxi drivers.

+ Shoes Off Before Entering Homes

A strict Asian household rule—always remove your shoes before entering a Singaporean home. Keeping them on is a major faux pas.

+ No Littering—Or Else

Singapore’s reputation as a clean city isn’t just because people are polite—it’s because littering comes with hefty fines. Chewing gum? Don’t even think about it.

+ Giving and Receiving with Both Hands

Whether handing over money, business cards, or gifts, using both hands is a sign of good manners in Singapore, showing respect to the other party.

+ No PDA, But No Staring Either

Public displays of affection (PDA) are relatively uncommon, but staring at others—whether on the MRT or in a mall—is equally bad etiquette.

+ Being Considerate on Public Transport

MRT and bus etiquette in Singapore includes giving up reserved seats for the elderly, pregnant women, and those with disabilities—though some commuters might pretend to be asleep to avoid doing so.

+ Tissue Packs as ‘Chope’ Markers

The "chope" culture in Singapore means placing a tissue packet on a hawker centre table to reserve it. Ignoring this and taking the seat anyway? A surefire way to annoy a local.

Mastering these Singapore manners and etiquette rules will help you blend in, avoid awkward encounters, and maybe even earn a few approving nods from locals.

### How can we in Singapore be more well-mannered?

+ Keep Your Legs Off Bus and MRT Seats
Public transport seats are for sitting, not footrests. Putting your legs up—especially with dirty shoes—is not just bad Singapore MRT and bus etiquette, but also unhygienic for the next commuter.

+ Practice Good Hygiene (Shower, Perfume, Deodorant!)
Singapore’s heat and humidity mean that body odor can become a public issue. Regular showers and deodorant are basic personal hygiene etiquette in Singapore, ensuring you stay fresh in crowded spaces like MRT trains and hawker centres. Should you shower in the morning? We'll cover this in a different post

+ Use Earphones, Not Speakers in Public
Blasting music, gaming sounds, or TikTok videos on public transport is a major Singapore pet peeve. Use earphones—it’s part of basic public transport etiquette in Singapore.

+ Say “Thank You” to Service Staff
Whether at hawker centres, shopping malls, or restaurants, acknowledging service workers with a simple “thank you” is an easy way to show good manners in Singapore.

+ Follow Walking and Escalator Etiquette
Walk on the left, stand on the left—except on escalators, where you stand on the left and walk on the right. Ignoring this rule is one of the biggest Singapore etiquette mistakes that annoy locals.

+ Respect Personal Space
Crowded places are common in Singapore, but standing too close in queues, trains, or lifts is uncomfortable. Keeping some distance is part of Singapore social etiquette.

+ Let People Alight Before Boarding the MRT or Bus
Rushing in before people exit doesn’t get you anywhere faster—it just slows down everyone. Singapore MRT etiquette is clear: let passengers alight first.

+ Dispose of Trash Properly
Despite Singapore’s reputation as a clean city, some still leave trash at hawker centre tables or drop tissue paper on the floor. Good etiquette in Singapore means using the bins provided.

+ Hold the Door for Others
Whether at a shopping mall or office, holding the door for the next person is a small but meaningful way to show politeness in Singapore.

+ Be Patient, Not Pushy
Singapore is known for efficiency, but that’s no excuse to shove through crowds or cut queues. Practicing patience is key to better manners in Singapore.

By following these simple Singapore etiquette rules, we can all contribute to a more courteous and pleasant environment—without needing constant reminders from public campaigns or fines. But let’s be real, I still see way too many people ignoring these basic manners every day.
