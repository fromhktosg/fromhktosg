Are we breathing properly in Singapore and should you practice breathwork?

Given the humid weather, air-conditioned offices, and occasional haze, you’d think we’d have mastered the art of inhaling and exhaling by now. But breathwork—yes, that’s a thing—goes beyond just surviving the MRT rush hour. Unlike meditation, which focuses on mindfulness, breathwork actively trains your lungs to work smarter, not harder. If ice baths aren’t your thing but you’re still looking for a way to boost energy and reduce stress, maybe it’s time to try controlling your breath instead. From relaxation to better focus, breathing might just be the wellness hack you didn’t know you needed—so let’s take a deep breath and explore.

### Why is the breath so important?

Breathing isn’t just about staying alive—it’s the key to better energy, mental clarity, and overall health. Science shows that deep diaphragmatic breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing cortisol levels and lowering stress. On the flip side, shallow chest breathing—something many Singaporeans do unconsciously due to long hours at desks and high humidity—can trigger the body's fight-or-flight response, increasing anxiety and fatigue. Proper breathwork improves oxygen exchange, enhances lung capacity, and even boosts athletic endurance by increasing CO2 tolerance. If you’re looking for an easy, science-backed way to feel better, optimizing your breath might be the best biohack yet.

### What is breathwork?

Breathwork is the practice of consciously controlling your breathing to improve physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Unlike the automatic, shallow breaths we take throughout the day, breathwork techniques focus on deep, intentional inhales and exhales to regulate the nervous system.

### How is breathwork different from meditation?

Breathwork involves actively controlling your breath to regulate the nervous system and achieve specific physical or mental benefits, while meditation focuses on quieting the mind and cultivating mindfulness. Essentially, breathwork is a dynamic practice, whereas meditation is more about stillness and mental presence.

### What are the benefits of breathwork?

<u>Benefits of Breathwork<u>

+ Reduces Stress and Anxiety: Breathwork activates the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering cortisol levels and promoting relaxation (backed by Western science on stress reduction).
+ Improves Mental Clarity and Focus: Techniques like box breathing enhance concentration and cognitive performance by increasing oxygen flow to the brain.
+ Boosts Energy and Endurance: The Wim Hof Method, for example, combines deep breathing with cold exposure to increase energy levels and physical endurance.
+ Enhances Emotional Regulation: Breathwork helps release pent-up emotions and balance mood, contributing to better emotional health (supported by both Western psychology and Eastern practices like yoga).
+ Improves Sleep Quality: Controlled breathing reduces overactive thinking, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.
+ Supports Immune Function: Breathwork can strengthen the immune system, with studies showing improved immune response through deep breathing techniques (Western and Asian wellness traditions support this).
+ Promotes Better Respiratory Health: Deep breathing increases lung capacity and oxygenation, improving overall respiratory function, particularly in practices like pranayama in yoga.
+ Helps in Pain Management: Breathwork can reduce the perception of pain by releasing endorphins, providing relief from chronic pain or discomfort.

### What breathing exercises are there?

+ Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing): Focuses on deep belly breaths to engage the diaphragm and promote relaxation.
+ Box Breathing: Involves inhaling, holding, exhaling, and holding for equal counts (e.g., 4 seconds each), commonly used for stress reduction and focus.
+ Wim Hof Method: Combines deep, controlled hyperventilation with cold exposure to increase oxygen levels and enhance endurance.
+ 4-7-8 Breathing: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds to help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.
+ Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana): Involves inhaling and exhaling through one nostril at a time, used to balance the body’s energy and calm the mind (popular in yoga).

Its a personal preference or which one to practice. I’m a big fan of the Wim Hof method and box breathing. A lot of these resources can be found on YouTube where you can practice for 20-30 minutes a day.

### When should you practice breathwork?

+ Morning: Start your day with a session of diaphragmatic breathing or the Wim Hof Method to boost energy, focus, and mental clarity.
+ During Stressful Moments: Use box breathing or 4-7-8 breathing when you’re feeling overwhelmed to calm your mind and regulate your emotions.
+ Before Sleep: Practice 4-7-8 breathing or diaphragmatic breathing to relax your body and improve sleep quality.
+ Throughout the Day: Integrate simple breathwork whenever you need a mental reset or emotional balance.

A deep breath before you make decisions or if you are feeling reactive goes a long wayt!

The best time for breathwork is when you need it most—whether for relaxation, focus, energy, or emotional regulation, and practicing with a partner or having someone hold you accountable can make it easier to stick to your routine.

+ "The Art of Breathing" by Danny Penman: A practical guide to mindfulness and breathwork, focusing on simple techniques to reduce stress and improve mental and physical health.

I’m personally a big fan of breath. Wellness is always a continuous practice. Check out [stretching](https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-stretching-muscle/) or [ice bathing](https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-ice-bath/) as alternatives too. Good luck on your pursuits!
