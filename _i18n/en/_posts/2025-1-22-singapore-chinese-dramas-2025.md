Chinese dramas—whether binge-watched on weekends or sneakily consumed during office lunch breaks—seem to hold a special place in the hearts of Singaporeans

For the uninitiated, Chinese TV dramas are a rich tapestry of sweeping romances, intense palace intrigues, and occasionally questionable CGI. But why do Singaporeans love them so much? Maybe it’s the nostalgia of seeing familiar Asian values, or maybe it’s the sheer joy of watching 50 episodes of dramatic misunderstandings unfold. From historical epics to modern urban tales, these dramas span categories that cater to every taste—and yes, they’re just a click away on various streaming platforms. Let’s dive into the top Chinese dramas of 2024 and the early favorites of 2025.

### What are Chinese TV dramas?

Chinese TV dramas, often called C-dramas, are television series produced in China, known for their diverse storylines, rich cultural elements, and highly addictive plots. These shows come in various genres, from sweeping historical epics (xianxia and wuxia fantasies) to modern urban romances and slice-of-life comedies. They often feature intricate storytelling, stunning costumes, and an ability to drag viewers into an emotional rollercoaster for 30 to 60 episodes—or more, if the producers get too ambitious. While some dramas are rooted in Chinese history and folklore, others reflect contemporary societal themes with a touch of melodrama. Whether you’re here for the jaw-dropping palace betrayals or a painfully slow-burn love story, there’s a C-drama for everyone.

### Why do Singaporeans like Chinese TV dramas?

Singaporeans love Chinese TV dramas partly because of their stunning casts, led by actresses who are practically walking perfection. Actresses like Zhao Lusi 赵露思 and Yang Zi 杨紫 bring both charm and relatability, making it easy for viewers to root for their characters—or binge entire seasons just for their performances. Male leads like Xiao Zhan 肖战 and Wang Yibo 王一博 also play a big role, with their brooding looks and on-screen charisma driving fans wild. Their flawless appearances, coupled with impeccable acting skills, often leave viewers swooning or aspiring to their beauty and fashion choices. Watching these actors and actresses light up the screen gives Singaporeans an irresistible mix of escapism, admiration, and just the right dose of fangirling that keeps them hooked on C-dramas.

### Types of Chinese TV dramas

Chinese TV dramas come in a variety of genres, each catering to different tastes and moods. Here’s a quick rundown:

+ Historical Dramas (古装剧) – Set in ancient times, featuring royal court intrigue, epic battles, and elaborate costumes (e.g., Story of Yanxi Palace 《延禧攻略》).
+ Fantasy Dramas (玄幻剧) – Often featuring mythical creatures, magic, and gods, like Eternal Love 《三生三世十里桃花》 (xianxia, anyone?).

+ Crime and Mystery (悬疑剧) – Filled with suspense, detectives, and thrilling storylines (e.g., Day and Night 《白夜追凶》).
