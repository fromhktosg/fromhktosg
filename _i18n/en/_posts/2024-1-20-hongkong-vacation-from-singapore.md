In this culinary exploration, we embark on a savory journey to uncover the origins, significance, and preparation of Bak Kut Teh, as well as unveil the best spots across the Lion City to savor this aromatic delight.

#### What is bak ku teh

Bak Kut Teh, a beloved culinary treasure in Singapore and across various Southeast Asian nations, derives its name from the Hokkien dialect, translating to "meat bone tea." This iconic dish boasts a symphony of rich flavors and tender textures, with succulent pork ribs taking center stage in a meticulously crafted broth. The broth itself is a masterpiece, infused with a harmonious blend of aromatic herbs and spices, showcasing the region's culinary prowess. The slow and deliberate simmering process not only tenderizes the meat but also allows the infusion of medicinal herbs such as ginseng, cinnamon, cloves, and star anise, resulting in a luxurious and flavorful concoction.
