Valentine's Day—an occasion that’s somehow become synonymous with overpriced flowers and forced romance—is right around the corner. While Singapore’s celebrations are a little less extravagant than those of some Western countries, the pressure to show affection through grand gestures is very much alive. Whether you're looking for ways to celebrate as a single, a couple, or wondering which flowers to pick for your special someone, this guide will offer some sarcastically practical advice on how to navigate this commercial holiday in Singapore.

### What is Valentine’s Day?

Valentine’s Day, celebrated on February 14, is a holiday dedicated to love, affection, and romantic gestures. It is widely recognized across the globe as a day to express feelings toward significant others, whether through gifts, flowers, chocolates, or simply spending quality time together. Over time, Valentine’s Day has evolved from its historical roots into a commercialized celebration of romance, particularly popular in Western cultures, though many countries now partake in the tradition.

### History of Valentine’s Day

The origins of Valentine’s Day are somewhat murky, with various theories about its inception. One popular legend ties the day to Saint Valentine, a Christian martyr. According to the story, Valentine was a priest in ancient Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius II. Claudius had outlawed marriages for young soldiers, believing that unmarried men made better fighters. Valentine, however, secretly married couples in defiance of the emperor's orders. For his actions, he was arrested and later executed on February 14.

Over time, the story of Saint Valentine became associated with love and romantic gestures, though the exact details remain unclear. By the Middle Ages, the day had gained a reputation as a time for courtship and romantic expression, especially with the influence of poets like Geoffrey Chaucer, who referenced the day in his work "Parliament of Fowls" in the 14th century.

Valentine's Day began to take its modern form in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in England, where people started exchanging hand-made cards, often with poems or messages of love. By the early 20th century, it became commercialized, with the greeting card and flower industries playing a huge role in the celebration we recognize today.

### Does Singapore celebrate Valentine's Day?

Singapore definitely celebrates Valentine's Day, though it’s less about deep-rooted tradition and more about hopping on the global bandwagon. While it may not have the same historical significance as in some Western countries, the island nation embraces the day with fervor—restaurants pack in couples, florists jack up their prices, and gifts fly off the shelves. Singles, of course, get their own brand of attention too, whether it’s through self-gifting or half-heartedly participating in "Singles Awareness Day."
