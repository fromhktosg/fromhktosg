Johor Bahru, or JB as Singaporeans affectionately call it, is a mere stone’s throw (or more accurately, a congested checkpoint) away from the Little Red Dot, sitting just across the Causeway. Once a sleepy town with historical ties to Singapore, JB has evolved into a bustling city tailored to Singaporean tastes—think affordable shopping, endless food options, and spa havens, all at a fraction of the price back home. Whether it’s the irresistible lure of cheap petrol or the intrigue of Malaysians commuting daily to Singapore, this dynamic relationship fuels a steady flow across the Causeway, making JB a hotspot for weekend getaways and weekday necessities.

### Where is JB in relation to Singapore’s location?

Johor Bahru (JB) is located just across the northern border of Singapore, separated by the Johor Strait. It's connected to Singapore by the Johor-Singapore Causeway, making it an easily accessible neighboring city. Geographically, JB is the southernmost city in Malaysia, serving as the gateway between the two countries and the destination for countless checkpoint adventures.

### What’s the history of JB and Singapore?

The history of Johor Bahru (JB) and Singapore is deeply intertwined, dating back to the days of the Johor Sultanate. Singapore was once part of the Johor Sultanate until the British acquired it in 1819, transforming it into a thriving trading hub. Meanwhile, JB, established in 1855 as Tanjung Puteri, grew under the reign of Sultan Abu Bakar, who modernized the city and fostered ties with Singapore. Over the years, JB and Singapore have evolved into close yet contrasting neighbors, each influencing the other. Singapore’s rapid urbanization and strict efficiency have often been complemented by JB’s more relaxed pace and affordability, creating a unique dynamic that draws people across the border daily.

### How do you cross to JB?

Crossing to Johor Bahru (JB) from Singapore is a straightforward yet potentially patience-testing experience, thanks to the infamous checkpoint process. The most common route is via the Johor-Singapore Causeway, a 1-kilometer link connecting Woodlands in Singapore to Johor Bahru, often bustling with cars, buses, motorcycles, and pedestrians. Another option is the Second Link at Tuas, a quieter and longer route popular with those avoiding the chaotic peak-hour jams. Travelers must clear immigration and customs at both Singapore and Malaysia checkpoints, presenting passports and, in some cases, travel permits or vehicle passes. Whether you’re driving (and dealing with ERP gantries), taking a bus (which might involve switching vehicles mid-crossing), or hopping on the train (a quicker but less frequent option), navigating the checkpoint is a rite of passage for anyone venturing across the border for JB’s food, shopping, or affordable luxuries.

To travel from Singapore to Johor Bahru (JB) by bus, you have several options. Here are the popular bus services:

+ Causeway Link: Services like CW1, CW2, and CW5 run from various locations in Singapore (such as Queen Street, Jurong East, or Kranji MRT) to JB’s Larkin Terminal or the JB Sentral.
+ Swee Choon: Offers buses from the Queen Street Terminal in Singapore to Larkin Terminal in JB.
+ Cross Border Shuttle Bus: There’s also the shuttle bus service between Singapore and JB, which operates from the Woodlands Checkpoint to JB Sentral.
+ Starmart Express: Provides buses from various Singapore terminals like Golden Mile Tower to JB’s Larkin Terminal.

Bus schedules may vary, and travel times can be influenced by the traffic at the checkpoints. It's a good idea to check bus timetables before your trip and prepare for possible delays at the border!
