Singapore’s MRT system is known for its efficiency—until, of course, you’re stuck waiting for a train that refuses to arrive.

Lately, train delays in Singapore seem to be popping up more frequently, leaving commuters frustrated and wondering what went wrong. From signal faults to mysterious “track intrusions,” these disruptions always come with an apologetic announcement but little real comfort. Compared to global transport systems, Singapore’s delays might not be the worst, but when you’re late for work, it sure doesn’t feel that way. In this guide, we’ll break down why train delays happen, which countries have it worse, where to check for real-time updates, and—most importantly—how to survive the wait without losing your sanity (or your job).

### Why have there been train delays in Singapore lately?

Singapore's MRT system has recently experienced several notable disruptions, leaving commuters questioning the reliability of their daily transit. Here are some specific incidents:

+ September 25, 2024 – East-West Line Disruption: A first-generation Kawasaki Heavy Industries train suffered a fault near Clementi station, leading to a significant service disruption between Jurong East and Buona Vista stations. This incident affected approximately 500,000 out of 2.8 million daily MRT journeys.

+ October 10, 2024 – East-West Line Delay: A westbound train stalled near Tiong Bahru MRT station due to an electrical fault. Passengers were safely disembarked at Outram Park station, and services resumed after about an hour.

+ October 22, 2024 – Bukit Panjang LRT Disruption: A train fault on the Bukit Panjang LRT line led to service disruptions during the evening peak hours. Shuttle train services operated between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang stations, and free bus services were provided to assist affected commuters.

+ November 15, 2024 – Thomson-East Coast Line Service Interruption: A train fault caused a nearly three-hour disruption on the Thomson-East Coast Line. Affected passengers were assisted, and free bus services were deployed between Woodlands North and Lentor stations during the downtime.

These incidents highlight the challenges faced by Singapore's MRT system in maintaining consistent service reliability.

### Why do train delays happen?

Train delays in Singapore can happen for several reasons, ranging from technical issues to external factors. Here are the most common causes:

+ Train Faults – Mechanical or electrical issues, such as faulty doors, power failures, or track circuit problems, can halt operations. Aging train models, especially on the North-South and East-West Lines, are more prone to these issues.

+ Signal Failures – MRT trains rely on a complex signaling system to maintain safe distances and regulate speed. When the system malfunctions, trains may slow down or stop entirely, leading to longer waiting times.

+ Track Intrusions – Unauthorized people or objects on the tracks (such as stray animals, debris, or even curious individuals) can trigger emergency shutdowns, causing significant delays while authorities investigate.

+ Planned Maintenance and Testing – While necessary to keep the system running smoothly, maintenance work can sometimes overrun schedules, causing unexpected disruptions during peak hours.

+ Weather Conditions – Heavy rain and lightning, common in Singapore, can interfere with above-ground tracks and even delay certain automated safety checks, slowing down train services.

+ Passenger-Related Incidents – Medical emergencies, accidental platform falls, or commuters forcing train doors open can disrupt services and cause knock-on delays across multiple stations.

+ Power Supply Issues – The MRT network relies on a stable power supply. Voltage dips or outages can shut down entire sections of the network, requiring emergency repairs before service resumes.

### What countries have the most train delays?

Train delays are a global problem, but some countries are particularly notorious for frequent train disruptions, railway strikes, and unreliable train schedules. Whether it's aging railway infrastructure, overcrowded train networks, or extreme weather conditions, these nations struggle with punctual train services. If you think Singapore’s MRT train delays are frustrating, take a look at the worst offenders worldwide.

1. India – The Land of Never-Ending Train Delays

India operates one of the largest and busiest railway networks in the world, but train congestion, outdated infrastructure, and unpredictable weather lead to massive disruptions.
Long-distance express trains like the Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express and Duronto Express frequently arrive hours behind schedule due to overloaded train routes and track maintenance issues.

2. United Kingdom – Train Strikes & Signaling Failures

The UK railway system suffers from constant train strikes, train cancellations, and technical failures.
London train delays are common, especially on Gatwick Express, Avanti West Coast, and Southern Rail services.
In 2024, over 40% of UK trains were delayed or canceled, marking one of the worst years for British railway reliability.

3. United States – Amtrak’s Endless Delays

The Amtrak train network in the United States is notorious for multi-hour train delays, especially on long-haul routes like the California Zephyr and Empire Builder.
Freight train interference is a major issue, as Amtrak passenger trains must give way to cargo trains, causing significant service disruptions.

4. Germany – Deutsche Bahn’s Train Delay Epidemic

Germany’s Deutsche Bahn (DB), once known for efficiency, now struggles with chronic train delays due to track maintenance, signaling failures, and an aging train fleet.
In 2023, nearly one-third of all long-distance trains in Germany arrived late, frustrating commuters and tourists alike.

5. France – SNCF’s Strikes & Overcrowded Trains

France’s SNCF railway network experiences frequent rail strikes, technical failures, and overcrowding.
TGV high-speed trains are generally reliable, but regional and commuter trains face regular disruptions and delays.

<u>Honorable Mentions<u>

+ Italy – Train strikes and railway delays are part of daily life.
+ Japan – Usually punctual, but rural and non-Shinkansen lines experience delays due to typhoons, snow, and earthquakes.
+ Australia – Sydney and Melbourne’s commuter rail networks suffer from frequent train cancellations, signaling faults, and infrastructure problems.

### What to do during a train delay in Singapore?

How to handle MRT delays in Singapore like a pro.

<u>Scenario 1: Before You Leave Home (Pre-Commute Planning)<u>

+ Check for MRT service disruptions: Before stepping out, check MyTransport.SG, Google Maps, Telegram channels, or news websites for real-time MRT train delay updates.
+ Consider alternative routes: If there’s a major breakdown, take a bus, LRT, or Grab/Gojek instead. Apps like Citymapper can suggest new routes.
+ Leave earlier (or later, if possible): Peak-hour delays mean packed buses and longer waits, so adjusting your timing might save you the stress.
+ Inform your employer/classmates: If you know you’ll be late, drop a text or email—some offices allow WFH on delay days.
+ Grab a coffee or breakfast: If you’re not in a rush, enjoy a kopi or kaya toast while waiting for updates. Better than standing at the station doing nothing!

<u>Scenario 2: During Your Commute (When You're Already Stuck)<u>

+ Stay updated & listen for announcements: Check the MRT station display boards, social media updates, or train intercom announcements for delay durations.
+ Exit and find alternative transport: If the delay is long, switch to a nearby bus stop, Grab/Gojek, or walk to the next station. Apps like Bus@SG can help you find bus options.
+ Keep calm and be patient: Rushing to the doors or panicking won’t help—train operators usually restore service within minutes, unless it’s a major fault.
+ Charge your phone & keep entertained: If you're stuck, use the time to clear emails, scroll social media, or read an e-book (or just enjoy some people-watching).
+ Help others if needed: If you see elderly passengers, pregnant women, or tourists confused about the delay, lend a hand. A little kindness goes a long way!

Happy commuting! Or you can drive instead.
