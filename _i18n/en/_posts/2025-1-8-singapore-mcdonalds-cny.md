McDonald’s Singapore has had quite the year—rising prices, shrinking portions, and yet, somehow, the queues keep getting longer. As Chinese New Year approaches, it seems nothing says “festive celebration” quite like a McSpicy and fries, because who needs tradition when you have convenience? In this article, we’ll dive into whether McDonald’s is still worth the splurge, what limited-edition goodies they’re rolling out for the season, and how you can snag the highly coveted Melody Mahjong set before it inevitably sells out.

### How has McDonald's in Singapore been the past year?

Over the past year, McDonald's Singapore has experienced notable changes, particularly in pricing and operational strategies. In response to inflationary pressures, the company has implemented price adjustments, including the introduction of charges for additional condiments such as curry and honey mustard sauces, effective from January 2025.

Despite these price increases, McDonald's has continued to offer value promotions to attract customers. For instance, in October 2024, a buy-one-get-one-free promotion for Samurai Burgers was available exclusively for McDonald's members.

On the corporate front, McDonald's Corporation (MCD) has shown resilience in the stock market. Starting 2024 at $285.96, the stock traded at approximately $298.84 by the end of the year, marking a 5% increase.

However, the company faced challenges, including an E. coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder hamburgers in October 2024, which temporarily impacted its stock price.

In summary, while McDonald's Singapore has adjusted its pricing in response to economic factors, it continues to implement promotional strategies to maintain customer engagement. The parent company's stock has demonstrated growth over the past year, despite facing certain operational challenges.

In 2024, McDonald's Singapore delighted customers with a variety of seasonal burgers, each offering unique flavors and experiences. Here are some highlights:

+ Sweet BBQ McSpicy® with Egg & Cheese: Introduced in August 2024, this burger features the classic spicy chicken cutlet enhanced with sweet BBQ crème sauce, a fried egg, and melted cheese. It was available as part of an Extra Value Meal starting from S$8.00.
+ Sweet BBQ McSpicy® with Chicken Bacon: Launched alongside the Egg & Cheese variant, this burger combines the fiery McSpicy® patty with sweet BBQ crème sauce and crispy chicken bacon. The Extra Value Meal was priced from S$8.00.
+ Samurai Beef Burger: Making a comeback in September 2024, this fan-favorite includes a juicy teriyaki-glazed beef patty, crisp lettuce, and creamy mayonnaise. The Extra Value Meal started at S$7.95.
+ Samurai Chicken Burger: Also reintroduced in September 2024, this burger offers a tender teriyaki-glazed chicken patty with lettuce and mayonnaise. The Extra Value Meal was available from S$7.95.
