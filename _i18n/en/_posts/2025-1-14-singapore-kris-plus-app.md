When it comes to loyalty programs, Kris+ by Singapore Airlines takes the idea of "more is more" to heart—more points, more rewards, and more places to spend them. But hey, who’s complaining about getting rewarded for shopping, dining, or just living your best life? In this article, we’ll dive into the perks, quirks, and all the reasons Kris+ might just become your new favorite app—whether you’re a miles collector or simply love a good deal.

### What is Kris+?

Kris+ is Singapore Airlines’ all-in-one lifestyle rewards app that combines earning and redeeming KrisFlyer miles with exclusive deals, promotions, and privileges. It allows users to earn miles on everyday spending at partner merchants, redeem miles for discounts, and enjoy curated offers across dining, retail, and entertainment. More than just a loyalty app, Kris+ aims to enhance the travel and lifestyle experience by turning miles into real-world rewards—and giving you plenty of reasons to keep using it even when you're not flying.

At its core, Kris+ is a clever fusion of convenience and gratification, designed to make your everyday spending feel a little more glamorous. Why settle for just paying the bill when you can earn miles while you’re at it? From trendy cafes to luxury retailers, the app transforms your spending into a points-earning extravaganza—and throws in exclusive deals to sweeten the pot. It’s like Singapore Airlines is saying, “Thank you for your loyalty; now go treat yourself!”

### History of Kris +

Kris+ started as KrisPay in 2018, Singapore Airlines’ innovative foray into digital wallets and loyalty rewards. Initially designed to allow members to convert KrisFlyer miles into digital currency, it offered a simple, cashless way to redeem miles at selected merchants. Over time, KrisPay evolved into Kris+, expanding its scope from a transactional app to a fully integrated lifestyle platform. With features like personalized offers, real-time earning and redemption capabilities, and an ever-growing network of partners, Kris+ became more than just a digital wallet—it became a loyalty powerhouse.

The transformation from KrisPay to Kris+ reflected Singapore Airlines’ broader strategy to keep pace with changing consumer habits and expectations. By rebranding and upgrading its features, the airline effectively positioned Kris+ as a one-stop app for travel and lifestyle benefits. The introduction of partnerships across dining, retail, and even experiences allowed it to appeal to a broader audience, including those who might not be frequent flyers. Today, Kris+ stands as a shining example of how traditional loyalty programs can evolve to stay relevant in an increasingly digital and convenience-driven world.

Whether it’s dining, shopping, or unique experiences, the app’s real-time redemption feature ensures that your miles are always working for you.

### Why Download Kris+?

In a world where convenience and rewards go hand in hand, Kris+ stands out as a must-have app for anyone who values getting the most out of their spending.

Whether you’re a seasoned traveler, a foodie, or a shopaholic, Kris+ offers something unique for everyone—and that’s why it deserves a spot on your phone.

### What’s the most effective strategy for Kris+?

The most effective strategy for Kris+ is to leverage its ability to maximize rewards by using the app for payments while linking your credit card. This approach ensures you earn rewards on two fronts: first, you’ll accumulate your usual credit card miles, cashback, or points depending on your card’s benefits. Simultaneously, every transaction made through Kris+ earns you Kris+ miles, which can be transferred to your KrisFlyer account to unlock flights, upgrades, or other travel perks.

To truly optimize your earnings, pay close attention to which restaurants and stores in the Kris+ network offer higher points multipliers. Some partners provide bonus miles or exclusive promotions, making it easier to rack up rewards faster. By combining credit card rewards with Kris+ miles and strategically selecting high-earning merchants, you can turn everyday spending into a seamless journey toward bigger rewards. It’s the ultimate win-win for savvy shoppers and travelers alike. For example, Clipper Tea in Ion Orchard offers a 9 point bonus for every $ spent. Now that’s a great deal.

### What is the downside to Kris+?

The downside to the Kris+ loyalty program is mainly its limitations on the rewards and benefits it offers. For example:

+ Limited Redemption Options: You may not always find enough variety in the types of rewards available, especially if you're looking for high-value items or more flexibility.
+ Point Expiry: Points earned might expire after a certain period, which can make it tricky if you're not actively using the program.
+ Exclusivity: Some promotions or deals may only be available to specific users or require additional spending thresholds that not everyone can reach.
+ Partner Limitations: The program's redemption partners might not cover every type of service or product you're interested in.
+ Complexity: Some users find navigating through the different rewards and understanding how to maximize points a bit complex.
