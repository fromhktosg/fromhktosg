Kopi in Singapore is more than just a drink—it’s practically a national pastime and a key part of Singapore coffee culture. 

We wrote about coffee in a previous [article](https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-coffee-starbucks/). What about Kopi? It's that sweet, strong traditional Singaporean coffee that you’ve probably encountered at every [hawker centre](https://fromhktosg.github.io/hk-versus-sg-food/), often served with a side of Singaporean charm (or maybe a long wait). But before you make any assumptions, let’s clear up the difference between Kopi vs Western coffee and break down the many ways of ordering Kopi in Singapore—because ordering it wrong could definitely get you some raised eyebrows. Need a guide to Singapore's kopi terminology or want to settle the Kopi C vs Kopi O debate once and for all? We've got you covered. Whether you're wondering what goes well with Kopi (hint: a classic Kopi and kaya toast pairing never fails) or just looking for the best Kopi spots in Singapore, this is your ultimate guide. And for those days when you’re feeling less coffee and more tea—well, don’t worry, there’s a solution for that too.

### What is Kopi?

The word kopi comes from the Malay and Indonesian languages, which both borrowed it from the Dutch word koffie, meaning coffee. This reflects the colonial influence in Southeast Asia, where coffee cultivation and trade flourished under European powers. In Singapore, kopi has evolved into its own distinct style, referring specifically to the strong, bold coffee brewed with robusta beans and typically sweetened with condensed or evaporated milk. Unlike Western-style coffee, Singapore’s kopi is made using a sock-like cloth filter and brewed in metal pots, giving it a rich, smooth taste that locals swear by.

### Kopi vs coffee

+ Kopi – Traditional Singaporean coffee made with robusta beans, brewed using a cloth filter, and often mixed with condensed or evaporated milk for a rich, sweet flavor.
+ Coffee – Typically refers to Western-style coffee, brewed with arabica or robusta beans using espresso machines, drip coffee makers, or French presses, with a more varied range of flavors and textures.

### What if I want tea instead?

If you’re in the mood for tea instead of kopi, Singapore has plenty of delightful options to satisfy your cravings, all while maintaining that local charm.

+ Teh Tarik – The Singaporean milk tea that's "pulled" to create a frothy top. This is the perfect alternative if you’re looking for something similar to kopi, but with a creamier, smoother texture.
+ Teh – A simple cup of black tea with sugar, a local favorite for those who prefer a less creamy but still rich, sweet flavor.
+ Teh C – For something a bit stronger, try Teh C, which is made with condensed milk, offering a sweet and thick tea experience.
+ Teh Halia – If you prefer your tea with a kick, Teh Halia adds a touch of ginger, making it a great warming alternative to your typical kopi.
+ Chinese Tea – Opt for a traditional Chinese tea if you’re looking for something lighter and less sweet. Jasmine tea or oolong tea are common choices in local kopitiams.
+ Iced Lemon Tea – A refreshing, cold alternative to hot beverages, often found at hawker centers or cafes.

For all the kopi lovers looking for a change, Singapore's tea offerings are just as rich and full of flavor. Whether you want something sweet like Teh Tarik or a refreshing iced tea, you’re sure to find the perfect tea to sip alongside your favorite snacks.

Happy drinking!
