If you love scoring a good deal, convincing yourself you're "saving" money while spending more, or simply enjoy browsing endless discount racks, outlet malls might be your happy place. These shopping destinations promise luxury brands at unbeatable prices—because who doesn’t want last season’s fashion for a fraction of the cost?

In Singapore, IMM Outlet Mall is the largest and most well-known, packed with factory outlets and clearance stores. But why are outlet malls cheaper in the first place? Are they really offering huge savings, or is it just a clever marketing trick? And if IMM isn’t enough, just hop across the border to Johor Premium Outlets (JPO) and other JB outlet malls, where even bigger discounts await. You won't get these deals in [Ion Orchard](https://fromhktosg.github.io/shopping-in-singapore/)!

### What Are Outlet Malls?
Outlet malls are shopping centers that sell discounted goods, often from factory outlets, clearance stores, and past-season collections. Unlike regular malls, which offer the latest trends at full price, outlet malls focus on lower-cost alternatives.

These discounts come from:
✅ Factory-direct stores selling overstocked items or designs that didn’t make the retail cut.
✅ Slightly imperfect products that don’t meet flagship store standards.
✅ Marketing tactics, where brands create “outlet-exclusive” products that may not be the same quality as their mainline items.

With promises of “Up to 70% off”, outlet malls sound like a dream—but are the deals as good as they seem? Sometimes, the "discounted" price is just what you should have been paying in the first place.

Stay tuned as we explore IMM, Johor Premium Outlets (JPO), and other must-visit outlet malls—plus tips to make sure you’re actually getting a bargain.

### Why do people like outlet malls?

Singaporeans love outlet malls for one simple reason: big brands at small prices. Whether it’s snagging a luxury handbag at a discount or scoring sportswear deals, outlet malls make shopping feel like a win. Here’s why they’re so popular:

1. Branded Goods Without the Guilt
Luxury brands and sportswear at lower prices? It feels like saving money, even when spending more.

2. IMM is Singapore’s Only Real Outlet Mall
With limited options in Singapore, IMM Outlet Mall is the go-to for bargain hunters.

3. Shopping is a National Hobby
Retail therapy is serious business in Singapore, and finding a deal makes it even better.

4. Kiasu Mentality
Scoring a discount before someone else? Bragging rights unlocked.

5. Pre-JB Warm-Up
IMM is good practice before heading to Johor Premium Outlets (JPO) for even bigger deals.

6. Outlet Malls Feel Like a Smart Buy
Even if the “discount” is just marketing, it still feels better than paying full price.

7. Air-Con & Entertainment
Indoor shopping, plenty of food options, and no sweating under the sun? Perfect weekend activity.

### Why are outlet malls cheaper?

Outlet malls offer lower prices because brands use them to offload excess inventory while still making a profit. Here’s how they keep prices down:

✅ Overstock & Past Seasons – Unsold items from retail stores get moved to outlets.
✅ Factory Outlet-Exclusive Products – Some brands make lower-cost versions just for outlet malls.
✅ Slight Defects & Irregulars – Minor flaws = bigger discounts.
✅ Bulk Discounts – Outlet stores buy in huge quantities, reducing costs.
✅ Lower Rent & Operational Costs – Many outlet malls are outside city centers, cutting overhead costs.
✅ Psychological Pricing Tricks – “Original” prices are often inflated so discounts look bigger.
✅ Constant Sales Strategy – Unlike regular malls, outlet malls always run promotions to keep shoppers coming.

Are the deals real? Sometimes. Is it fun? Always.

### What outlet malls are there in Singapore?

Singapore has limited outlet mall options, but if you're looking for branded discounts, here are the best spots:

1. IMM Outlet Mall (Jurong East) – Singapore’s Largest Outlet Mall

✅ Over 100 outlet stores, including Nike, Adidas, Coach, Michael Kors, and Clarks
✅ Offers up to 80% off retail prices year-round
✅ Features a mix of fashion, sportswear, and lifestyle brands

2. Changi City Point (Near Expo) – Best for Sports & Lifestyle Deals

✅ Home to Nike, Puma, Timberland, and other sports brands
✅ Features outlet clearance events and seasonal discounts
✅ Convenient location for East-side shoppers

For even bigger savings, serious bargain hunters head to Johor Bahru, where outlet malls like Johor Premium Outlets (JPO) offer even steeper discounts on global brands.

### What stores are there in IMM mall?

IMM Mall in Singapore boasts over 100 outlet stores, offering discounts of up to 80% year-round.

Shoppers can find a variety of brands, including:
+ Fashion and Accessories: Coach, Calvin Klein, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger, and Club 21
+ Sportswear: Nike, Adidas, ASICS, and New Balance.
+ Footwear: Clarks, Converse, Crocs, and Sketchers
+ Home and Furnishing: Absolute Bedding, Akemi Outlet, and Hoe Kee.

The biggest luxury store at IMM is probably Club21. Club 21 is a well-known fashion retailer in Singapore that carries a mix of high-end and contemporary designer labels. Some brands include - 

+ Armani Exchange – Casual yet stylish fashion from Giorgio Armani’s more accessible line.
+ DKNY – New York-inspired contemporary fashion with a chic, urban edge.

Why doesn’t IMM have more ultra luxury brands akin to the LVs / Guccis? Probably because Singaporeans are willing to pay more for those brands so no discounts are required.

### How do you get to IMM mall?

You can get to IMM Mall in several ways:
+ By MRT + Free Shuttle – Take the East-West Line to Jurong East MRT Station (EW24/NS1), then hop on the free IMM shuttle bus from the station (pickup at JCube).

### What outlet malls are there close to Singapore, such as in Johor Bahru (JB), Malaysia?

Many Singaporeans look to JB for their outlet mall adventures.

If Singapore’s outlet options aren’t enough, Johor Bahru (JB), Malaysia, has several outlet malls with even bigger discounts:

+ Johor Premium Outlets (JPO) – The largest and most well-known, featuring luxury and premium brands like Coach, Michael Kors, Polo Ralph Lauren, Nike, Adidas, and more.
+ Paradigm Mall JB (Factory Outlet Store) – Offers sportswear and casual fashion brands at lower prices.
+ R&F Mall JB (Occasional Outlet Sales) – Not a dedicated outlet mall, but some stores offer clearance discounts.
+ Mid Valley Southkey (Outlet Sections in Some Stores) – Certain retailers have outlet-style discounts within the mall.

For the best outlet experience, JPO is the top choice, but it’s about an hour’s drive from the Singapore-JB checkpoint.

Since it’s an outlet mall, expect past-season items and factory store exclusives at lower prices. Deals vary, so checking in-store is the best way to find bargains!

### How much cheaper are Johor Premium outlet products?

Johor Premium Outlets (JPO) generally offers lower prices than regular retail stores, but the discounts vary by brand and season. Here’s what to expect:

+ Typical Discounts: 25%–65% off retail prices, with some clearance items going up to 80% off.
+ Luxury Brands (Coach, Michael Kors, Polo Ralph Lauren, Versace): Usually 30%–50% off, with additional markdowns during sales.
+ Sportswear (Nike, Adidas, Puma, Under Armour): Discounts around 30%–60%, with special deals on past-season items.
+ Casual Fashion (Levi’s, Guess, Superdry): Often 40%–70% off, making them much cheaper than Singapore prices.
+ Luggage & Accessories (Tumi, Samsonite, Fossil): Prices can be 30% lower than in Singapore, plus extra savings during sales.

However, some items might be factory outlet exclusives, meaning they are made specifically for outlets and may differ in quality. Prices at JPO are also cheaper due to Malaysia’s weaker currency (MYR vs. SGD), making it a good deal for Singapore shoppers.

### What to watch out for when shopping at an outlet mall?

When shopping at an outlet mall, keep these things in mind:

+ Not Everything Is a Bargain – Some discounts are based on inflated “original” prices, so compare with regular retail prices before buying.
+ Factory Outlet Exclusives – Some brands produce lower-quality items specifically for outlets, meaning the materials or craftsmanship may differ from retail stores.
+ Limited Sizes & Stock – Outlets mostly carry past-season items, so you might not find your preferred size or color.
+ Return Policies Can Be Strict – Many outlet stores have final sale policies, meaning no returns or exchanges.
+ Holiday & Weekend Crowds – Expect long lines and packed stores, especially during major sales periods.
+ Exchange Rate Considerations (for JB Outlets) – If shopping in Malaysia, factor in the exchange rate to maximize savings.
+ Check for Additional Discounts – Some outlets offer extra savings with membership programs, credit card deals, or bulk-buy promotions.

Shopping smart at outlets means knowing when a deal is actually worth it!

My personal favourite is outlet shopping in Tokyo, such as in the Gotemba Premium outlets. Best deals are always in Japan. Singapore and Malaysia outlet shopping is bang average but hits the spot on a bad day. Happy shopping!
