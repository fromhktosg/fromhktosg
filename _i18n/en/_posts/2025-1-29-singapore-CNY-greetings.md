This week in Chinese new year - we wrote about it in an earlier article. Chinese New Year in Singapore isn’t just about feasting and collecting ang baos—it’s also the season of bai nian (拜年), where you visit relatives, exchange auspicious greetings, and try to remember who’s who in the extended family.

It’s a time-honored tradition where people make the rounds, armed with well-rehearsed blessings, hoping for good fortune (or at least a bigger red packet). But what exactly do you say when bai nian? What should you be eating to keep the festive spirit alive? And, most importantly, what unwritten rules should you absolutely not break? This guide will take you through the art of bai nian—from the greetings to the food and customs—so you can navigate the season like a pro (or at least not embarrass yourself).

### Why do people ‘bai nian’拜年?

When it comes to bai nian (拜年), not all visits are created equal—there’s a hierarchy to follow. The most important people on your list? Elders, starting with grandparents, parents, and senior relatives, because filial piety is everything (and also where the best ang baos come from). The first two days of Chinese New Year, Chu Yi (初一) and Chu Er (初二), are reserved for immediate and extended family, as these are the days you honor your elders and keep the family spirit alive. Married couples are next, as they are morally obligated to distribute red packets to the unmarried, which makes them prime targets for strategic visits. Close friends and colleagues also exchange festive greetings, though usually without the monetary incentives. And if you’re really committed, some even bai nian to bosses or business partners, because what better way to start the year than ensuring good office politics and future pay raises?

And then there are the unexpected bai nian interactions—the security guards at your condo or office, the neighborhood kopitiam uncle, and even your regular bubble tea cashier, because why not spread some extra goodwill (or subtly hint at better service for the rest of the year)? Some overachievers even bring mandarin oranges for these encounters, just to flex their festive etiquette.
