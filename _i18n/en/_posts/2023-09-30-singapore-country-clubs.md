I played tennis at the [Capella](https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-best-hotels/) a couple weeks back. Whilst it isn’t a country club, the establishment in its grandeur and luxury sure felt like one.

Having personally experienced the allure of country clubs while being part of one in Hong Kong, I was naturally drawn to explore what Singapore's country clubs have to offer. Today, we’ll unpack a little about country clubs, including the verdant landscapes and luxurious amenities and weighing the question on everyone's mind: Are they worth it? Join me as we unravel the world of Singaporean country clubs and discover whether these exclusive enclaves truly live up to their reputation.

#### What are the 5 C’s that all Singaporeans revere?

In the realm of Singaporean culture and lifestyle, the "5 Cs" have long held a special place. Historically symbolizing cash, car, credit card, condominium and country club, these markers of affluence have shaped aspirations and defined success for generations of Singaporeans. These five Cs are:
+ Cash: Refers to the pursuit of wealth and financial success
+ Car: Singapore's car prices are among the highest in the world due to significant taxes and fees, making car ownership a status symbol
+ Credit Card: Self-explanatory, although getting a credit card was much more difficult a generation back
+ Condo: Owned private real estate versus government housing (HDBs) is much more valuable (and comfortable)
+ Country Club: Joining an exclusive country club is considered a symbol of prestige

While the concept of the five C's is often taken lightly, many Singaporeans adhere to its philosophy and aspire to 'collect them all.'

#### How did country clubs come about in Singapore?

The roots of country clubs can be traced back to a time when colonial influences and British traditions shaped Singapore's landscape. These clubs emerged as enclaves where colonial expatriates gathered to escape the tropical heat, indulge in recreational activities, and foster a sense of community. Over the decades, these exclusive retreats have evolved to become more diverse, catering to the changing demographics and interests of Singapore's populace. However, this is also the reason why many country clubs are named after particular countries i.e. The American Club.

#### Why should you join a country club?

During my membership at a country club in Hong Kong, I dedicated the majority of my time to utilizing their tennis facilities, spending six days a week there for training. In fact, the country club became my third most frequently visited location, following my school and home. A good amount of my friends hung out there too. Looking back, I loved being part of that community. Here’s why there’s merit in joining a country club - 

+ Sanctuary lifestyle: At their core, country clubs in Singapore serve as sanctuaries, offering members an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban living. They are nestled amidst lush greenery, providing an oasis of tranquility where one can reconnect with nature, unwind, and recharge. It's a place where time seems to slow down, and the stresses of daily life fade into the background
+ Facilities: One of the defining features of country clubs is their extensive range of recreational facilities. While golf courses remain a hallmark, these clubs have diversified to include tennis courts, swimming pools, gyms, and even equestrian facilities.

Associate memberships are often available to family members of full members or individuals who do not meet the criteria for full membership.
+ Social or Non-Golfing Membership: Social members typically have access to the club's dining, social events, and some recreational facilities but do not have golfing privileges. This membership category is suitable for individuals or families who are primarily interested in the club's social aspects.
