Decathlon is the go-to store in Singapore if you suddenly decide you’re an athlete—or at least want to look like one.

Founded in France in 1976, Decathlon made its way to Singapore in 2016 and has since expanded faster than your list of abandoned fitness goals. With multiple locations across the island, from sprawling warehouses to compact urban stores, it’s almost too easy to convince yourself you need another pair of running shoes. The brand is famous for its shockingly low prices, making you wonder if they’ve cracked some secret formula for cheap sports gear (spoiler: they have). But is their quality good enough to survive your ambitious workout plans, and what are the best things to buy? Let’s find out.

### What is Decathlon?

Decathlon is a French sporting goods retailer founded in 1976 in Lille with a simple mission—making sports accessible to everyone, whether you're a hardcore athlete or just buying yoga pants for lounging. The brand quickly expanded across Europe and beyond, thanks to its unbeatable combination of affordability and in-house product innovation. It eventually landed in Singapore in 2016, opening its first megastore in Bedok, and has since spread across the island with both massive experience stores and compact city outlets. Known for its in-house labels like Quechua (outdoor gear) and Kalenji (running shoes), Decathlon offers decent quality without the premium price tag, making it a go-to for budget-conscious fitness enthusiasts. Today, it’s practically a household name in Singapore, proving that you don’t need to spend a fortune to look like you exercise regularly.

### Where are Decathlon stores in Singapore?

Decathlon has made sure you’re never too far from affordable sports gear by planting stores all over Singapore’s malls. Their megastores—like the ones in Kallang and Bedok—are massive playgrounds where you can test everything from bicycles to trampolines before buying. For those who prefer convenience over adventure, Decathlon also has smaller city outlets in malls like Orchard, City Square, and Northshore Plaza. They’ve even gone futuristic with self-service stores like Decathlon Click & Collect, where you can pick up your online orders without dealing with human interaction (perfect for introverts). Whether you want the full Decathlon experience or just a quick grab-and-go, there’s likely a store near you.
