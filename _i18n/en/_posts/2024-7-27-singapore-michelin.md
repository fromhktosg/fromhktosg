Singapore has firmly established itself as a global gastronomic hub, with a growing number of establishments earning the prestigious Michelin stars. As of 2023, there are 55 Michelin-starred restaurants in the city-state, including 46 one-star, 6 two-star, and 3 three-star establishments.

The Michelin Guide has recognized the exceptional quality, creativity, and service that define the finest dining experiences in Singapore. Beyond the top-tier establishments, the Michelin Guide has also shone a spotlight on Singapore's vibrant hawker culture. 

The proliferation of Michelin-starred restaurants in Singapore is a testament to the city's thriving food culture and the exceptional talent of its chefs. Today, we'll explore this dynamic Michelin scene, uncovering the stories behind some of the most celebrated dining destinations in the Lion City. I’ll deliberately exclude the cheap michelin hawker places like Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle, or those who lost their stars or are now defunct (the three that come to mind are Vianney Massot, Basque kitchen or Jiang nan chun).

#### What is the Michelin guide and what are Michelin restaurants?

The Michelin Guide has become synonymous with culinary excellence, a hallmark of fine dining that chefs and restaurateurs around the world aspire to attain. However, the origins of this prestigious guide can be traced back to a rather unexpected source – the French tire company, Michelin. In 1900, the Michelin brothers, André and Édouard, published the first edition of the Michelin Guide as a promotional tool to encourage drivers to take more road trips and, in turn, purchase more tires. The guide initially provided practical information for motorists, including maps, locations of gas stations, and recommendations for hotels and restaurants.

It wasn't until 1926 that the Michelin Guide began to focus on the culinary aspect, with the introduction of a star-rating system to distinguish exceptional dining establishments. The brothers devised a simple hierarchy – one star meant the restaurant was "very good in its category," two stars indicated it was "worth a detour," and three stars signified it was "worth a special 
journey."

This shift in focus transformed the Michelin Guide into a renowned authority on fine dining, with its anonymous inspectors meticulously evaluating restaurants based on the quality of ingredients, mastery of cooking techniques, and overall dining experience. As the guide expanded its coverage beyond France to include other European countries and, eventually, the United States, the Michelin star became a coveted accolade that chefs and restaurateurs aspired to earn.
The importance of the Michelin Guide to the fine dining scene cannot be overstated. A Michelin star not only bestows prestige upon a restaurant but also has a tangible impact on its success. Establishments that receive Michelin recognition often experience a surge in demand, with diners eager to experience the exceptional cuisine that has been deemed worthy of the guide's highest honors.

Moreover, the Michelin Guide has played a pivotal role in shaping the culinary landscape, inspiring chefs to push the boundaries of their craft and strive for culinary excellence. The guide's influence has fostered a culture of innovation and creativity, as chefs seek to create dishes that captivate the palates of Michelin inspectors and, ultimately, discerning diners.
In the end, the Michelin Guide's journey from a humble tire company's promotional tool to the global arbiter of fine dining is a testament to the power of innovation and the enduring allure of culinary excellence. As the guide continues to evolve and expand its reach, its impact on the fine dining scene remains unparalleled, inspiring chefs and restaurateurs to reach new heights of culinary mastery.

#### Why does Singapore have so many Michelin star restaurants?

There are many reasons to why Singapore is littered with Michelin star restaurants?

+ Vibrant and Diverse Culinary Scene: Singapore has a thriving food culture influenced by various cuisines including Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Peranakan. This diverse culinary landscape provides a strong foundation for exceptional dining experiences that appeal to Michelin inspectors
+ Focus on Quality and Innovation: Restaurants in Singapore are known for their commitment to using high-quality ingredients, mastering cooking techniques, and showcasing the personality and creativity of their chefs. This attention to detail and innovation is highly valued by the Michelin Guide
+ Supportive Ecosystem: Singapore regularly hosts food-focused events and attracts high-profile chefs, creating an environment that fosters culinary excellence. The city's status as a global financial center also supports a luxury dining scene that aligns with Michelin's criteria
+ Michelin's Expansion Strategy: The Michelin Guide's decision to establish a presence in Singapore was influenced by the city's vibrant culinary scene and its potential to attract high-spending clientele. As the guide expanded beyond its traditional European roots, Singapore emerged as an attractive market to evaluate
+ Commitment to Consistency and Service: Restaurants in Singapore are praised for their ability to maintain consistent quality in both food and service, which are key factors considered by Michelin inspectors. The city's focus on exceptional hospitality also contributes to its success in earning Michelin stars
+ High willingness to pay: Rich people = larger market for expensive restaurants

#### Why are Michelin restaurants so damn expensive?

There are a few key reasons why Michelin-starred restaurants in Singapore can be quite expensive:
+ Prestige and Exclusivity: Michelin-starred restaurants are considered the pinnacle of fine dining, and this prestige and exclusivity allows them to command premium prices. Diners are often willing to pay higher prices for the Michelin-backed dining experience
+ High-Quality Ingredients and Preparation: Michelin-starred restaurants use the finest, freshest ingredients and employ highly skilled chefs who have mastered complex cooking techniques. This level of quality and craftsmanship comes at a cost that is reflected in the menu prices
+ Elaborate Dining Experiences: Many Michelin-starred restaurants in Singapore offer multi-course tasting menus and elaborate dining experiences that can last several hours. The time, effort, and service involved in these experiences contribute to the high prices
+ Location and Ambiance: Restaurants located in premium areas or with stunning views and elegant decor can also charge higher prices to match the premium setting
+ Wine Pairings: Adding wine pairings to a Michelin-starred meal can significantly increase the overall cost, as the markups on wine at these establishments can be quite high

#### Are michelin restaurants worth it?

Whether a Michelin-starred meal is "worth it" comes down to the individual diner's priorities and budget. Personally, I feel most in Singapore are worth it but the lunch sets are a lot more accessible versus the full blown dinners.
