Pokémon: the little creatures that have been shocking each other for over two decades are back in Singaporean headlines—not that they ever truly left. Whether you're chasing the nostalgia of trading cards in the schoolyard or curious about why grown-ups are suddenly debating the merits of foil Charizards again, the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) is having a moment. From choosing between the shiny allure of digital battles or the tactile joy of physical decks, to figuring out where to play or if it's worth your wallet, let’s explore Singapore’s Pokémon obsession and its card game alternatives.

### What is Pokemon?

Pokémon, short for “Pocket Monsters,” is a Japanese franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, first launched in 1996 by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. It began as a pair of video games for the Game Boy—Pokémon Red and Green in Japan (later released as Red and Blue internationally)—where players captured and trained creatures to battle each other. The concept drew inspiration from Tajiri’s childhood hobby of collecting insects, which evolved into a worldwide phenomenon. The franchise quickly expanded beyond video games to include trading cards, an animated TV series, movies, toys, and a seemingly endless array of merchandise. At its core, Pokémon is about capturing and building bonds with fantastical creatures, encouraging themes of friendship, adventure, and strategy.

The franchise’s success overseas can be credited to a well-timed global marketing campaign in the late 1990s, coupled with the universal appeal of its “gotta catch ‘em all” motto. The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), launched in 1996 in Japan and 1998 globally, became a cultural sensation, with playgrounds across the world transformed into battlefields. The TV series, featuring the iconic Pikachu and Ash Ketchum’s quest to become a Pokémon Master, played a huge role in capturing international audiences. With its adaptable formula of video games, collectible cards, and multimedia storytelling, Pokémon became one of the most successful franchises in history, solidifying its place as a cultural icon. Today, its reach spans continents, appealing to both nostalgic adults and new generations of fans alike.

Pokémon made its way to Singapore in the late 1990s, riding the wave of its global success. The TV series, dubbed into local languages, captured the imagination of children who eagerly followed Ash and Pikachu's adventures on their quest to "catch 'em all." Local retailers soon stocked Pokémon trading cards, video games, and merchandise, turning every neighborhood mall into a hub of Pokémon fever. Events like card tournaments and meet-and-greets with costumed Pikachu mascots helped solidify its presence. Over the years, Pokémon has remained a beloved part of pop culture in Singapore, with new generations discovering the franchise through updated games, movies, and even Pokémon Go, which turned the island into a giant Pokémon-catching playground. Today, Pokémon continues to thrive in Singapore, bridging the gap between childhood nostalgia and modern-day gaming trends.

### What is the latest craze with Pokemon given its existed for so long?

The latest craze with Pokémon can largely be attributed to its ability to evolve—ironically, just like its creatures. While the franchise has always had a loyal fanbase, recent years have seen surges in popularity fueled by events like Pokémon Go's augmented reality phenomenon and the enduring appeal of the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG). The TCG, in particular, has captured headlines again as rare cards fetch eye-watering prices in auctions, turning casual collectors into treasure hunters. Nostalgia also plays a big role, as millennials and Gen Z rediscover the joy of battling and trading cards they cherished as kids, often alongside the introduction of new generations of Pokémon that keep the franchise fresh.

Additionally, Pokémon has embraced the digital age, offering expanded experiences like Pokémon Unite, an online multiplayer game, and Pokémon TCG Live, which brings the card game to virtual platforms. The blending of modern technology with classic elements has kept Pokémon relevant and exciting for both longtime fans and newcomers. From shiny card pulls to digital battle arenas, the franchise continues to prove that, despite being nearly 30 years old, its ability to “evolve” makes it timeless.

### Pokemon TCG - digital vs physical cards

The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) offers two distinct ways to play: the traditional physical card game and its digital counterpart, Pokémon TCG Live. Physical cards have a tactile charm that can’t be replicated—there’s something uniquely satisfying about tearing open a booster pack to find a coveted holofoil card or building a deck with friends. The physical TCG also carries a social component, with players meeting at local card shops, tournaments, or even café gatherings to battle and trade. However, it comes with the challenges of maintaining and organizing a collection, not to mention the cost of acquiring rare cards, which can quickly add up.

The digital version, on the other hand, offers convenience and accessibility. Pokémon TCG Live allows players to build decks, practice strategies, and play matches without needing a physical collection. It’s especially appealing for beginners or those looking to explore the game without a significant financial commitment. Yet, it lacks the tangible joy and collector’s appeal of physical cards. Interestingly, Pokémon has also bridged the gap between these worlds with code cards included in physical packs, allowing players to redeem them online for virtual items.

Adding to the Pokémon frenzy in Singapore are the Pokémon Ga-Olé machines found in various shopping malls. These arcade machines let players battle Pokémon digitally and earn physical discs representing the Pokémon they've captured—essentially a mini-hybrid of both worlds. Notable locations include Suntec City, which houses Singapore's largest Pokémon Ga-Olé Station with 12 machines ; Changi Airport Terminal 3; and FairPrice Xtra Parkway Parade. Kids and adults alike flock to these machines, transforming a simple trip to the mall into an impromptu Pokémon adventure. Together, these various formats ensure that Pokémon TCG, whether physical or digital, remains as diverse and accessible as ever.

### Where can you play Pokemon in Singapore?

Singapore offers a thriving scene for Pokémon TCG enthusiasts, with various locations where players can meet, trade, and battle. Official Pokémon League events, often hosted at local game stores, are a great starting point for beginners and experienced players alike. Popular venues include The Card Tavern at Dhoby Ghaut, Games@PI in Orchard, and Project EXT at Bugis, where weekly tournaments and casual meetups are common. These spaces not only provide a platform to play but also foster a community of like-minded fans.

For those who enjoy a more casual atmosphere, cafés like Kingdom Quests Café and Invictus Forge offer cozy environments to play while enjoying food and drinks. Public spaces like community centers and libraries occasionally host Pokémon TCG events, particularly during school holidays or special occasions. Additionally, pop-up events in malls like [Plaza Singapura](https://fromhktosg.github.io/shopping-in-singapore/), Jewel Changi Airport, and Suntec City add excitement to the scene, especially during the release of new card sets or special promotions. These temporary setups often feature exclusive merchandise, card battles, and even beginner tutorials, creating a buzz among fans. Whether you’re a competitive player or just want to trade cards, Singapore has plenty of options to fuel your Pokémon passion.

### How do you get started with Pokemon in Singapore?

Getting started with Pokémon in Singapore is relatively easy, whether you’re interested in the video games, trading cards, or both. If you’re diving into the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), your first step is to pick up a starter deck, which is a great way to learn the basic mechanics and start playing. The basic rules of the TCG are simple: each player starts with a deck of 60 cards, which include Pokémon cards (used for attacking), Trainer cards (for strategic moves), and Energy cards (used to power up attacks). Players take turns drawing cards, placing Pokémon on the battlefield, and using Energy cards to power up attacks to defeat their opponent's Pokémon. The goal is to "knock out" your opponent's Pokémon by reducing their hit points to zero, and the first player to draw all their prize cards wins.

For those who want to dive deeper, there are plenty of online resources, including YouTube tutorials and fan communities, that can teach you advanced strategies and help you understand the nuances of deck building. If you're more interested in the Pokémon video games, whether it's the latest Nintendo Switch titles like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, or mobile games like Pokémon Go, you’ll want to grab a copy of the game. Pokémon Go, in particular, is free-to-play and easy to pick up, with regular events in popular spots around Singapore like Orchard Road and Marina Bay. In Pokémon Go, the basic idea is to catch and train Pokémon, battle other players, and participate in raids and events. As you build your collection of Pokémon, you’ll also want to download the Pokémon Home app to manage your creatures and transfer them between games. Lastly, attending local Pokémon League events, whether in stores or at pop-up stations in malls, is a great way to meet other players and level up your skills while having fun. Scour telegram / facebook groups for this.

### Is it expensive to get into Pokemon in Singapore?

Getting into Pokémon in Singapore can be as affordable or as expensive as you choose, depending on how deeply you dive into the various aspects of the franchise. For Pokémon video games, if you're looking to play on the Nintendo Switch, the cost of the game itself (around SGD 60–90 for the latest titles like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet) is the primary expense. For Pokémon Go, the game is free to download and play, though optional in-game purchases for items like Poké Balls, Incense, and Remote Raid Passes can add up if you choose to spend money on them.
When it comes to the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), the cost can vary significantly depending on how much you want to invest. Starter decks are relatively affordable, typically costing around SGD 20–30, and are enough to get you started. However, as you become more involved in competitive play or collecting, you may find yourself purchasing booster packs, which can range from SGD 6–12 each, or even rare cards that can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on their rarity. Regular participation in official events or tournaments may also incur small entry fees, typically ranging from SGD 5–20 per event.
Overall, while getting into Pokémon in Singapore doesn't require a significant upfront investment, the hobby can become pricey if you get deeply involved in competitive gaming, rare card collecting, or if you frequently engage with in-game purchases for Pokémon Go. For those starting out, it’s possible to enjoy the experience without breaking the bank, especially with the wide availability of starter decks and free-to-play mobile games.
