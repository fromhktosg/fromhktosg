And if you're trying to master the art of scooping ice cream out of a carton like a pro, stick around for some tips that'll make you seem almost professional—almost.

### What is the difference between ice cream and gelato and sorbet

Ice cream, gelato, and sorbet may seem similar, but they each have distinct characteristics that set them apart.

+ Ice cream is made with cream, milk, sugar, and often eggs, giving it a rich and creamy texture. It typically has a higher fat content (at least 10%) and is churned faster, which incorporates more air and results in a lighter texture.
+ Gelato, the Italian cousin of ice cream, uses more milk and less cream, and it’s churned at a slower speed, creating a denser, smoother texture. It also has a lower fat content than traditional ice cream, which allows its flavors to shine more intensely.
+ Sorbet, on the other hand, is completely dairy-free, made with fruit puree, sugar, and water. It’s lighter and fruitier, with a refreshing texture that’s often a perfect choice for those avoiding dairy or looking for a more refreshing treat.

So while ice cream is creamy and rich, gelato is dense and flavorful, and sorbet is all about vibrant fruit and lightness—each perfect for different moods, climates, and dietary choices.

### If ice cream has no milk, is it still ice cream?

If ice cream uses milk powder instead of fresh milk, it can still technically be considered ice cream. The key factor in traditional ice cream is the use of dairy in some form, and milk powder is simply a dehydrated form of milk. In fact, many commercial ice cream brands use milk powder as a more stable and convenient ingredient to create that creamy texture and rich flavor we all crave. It tastes much worse though

### Can you make your own ice cream at home?

Whether you’re craving a classic vanilla or want to experiment with unique flavors, homemade ice cream can be customized to your liking. The best part? You can make it without an ice cream machine, though having one can make the process quicker and smoother. To get started, you'll need basic ingredients like cream, milk, sugar, and flavorings such as vanilla extract or fresh fruit. For a smoother texture, consider using heavy cream and condensed milk, which help achieve that rich, creamy consistency.

To make your homemade ice cream even better, you can experiment with unique flavors, mix-ins, or even try a dairy-free ice cream recipe using alternatives like coconut milk or almond milk. You can also try different methods, such as making no-churn ice cream that doesn't require an ice cream machine.

A simple Google search for easy homemade ice cream recipes will guide you to countless variations. Also, if you're wondering about the price, ice cream machine costs typically range from $150 to a few hundred dollars, depending on the brand and features. Don’t buy an ice cream machine. It’s too much effort.

### How to scoop ice cream out of a carton with ease?

Scooping ice cream out of a carton shouldn’t feel like a workout, yet we’ve all been there, battling a rock-hard block of frozen goodness. The best trick? Heat your ice cream scoop over a flame—just a few seconds over a gas stove or with hot water will do the trick. The warmth helps the scoop glide through the ice cream effortlessly, giving you that perfect, round scoop without bending your spoon in the process. If you don’t have a flame, running the scoop under hot water or dipping it in a mug of warm water works just as well. And if patience isn’t your thing, let the carton sit at room temperature for 5–10 minutes—just enough to soften the edges without turning it into a melty mess.

Ice cream’s always a treat! Enjoy.
