Welcome to my blog, From HK to SG (FHK2SG), your go-to guide for expat living in Singapore. 

I was born and raised in Hong Kong and spent 18 golden years growing up there. After a short stint in the States for college and work, I moved to Singapore to pursue a new career opportunity at a big tech company and have since settled into the country for the past 5 years. 

People often compare Hong Kong with Singapore and deservedly so. Both places are Asia powerhouses with a small land mass but a huge amount of economic opportunity. In recent years, more and more Hong Kong-ers have opted to move to Singapore, driven by an increasing number of reasons. With many friends reaching out on how life in Singapore is compared to Hong Kong or the US, I'd thought I share my own personal experience, anecdotes and hacks on smoothly transitioning to live in Singapore.

In this blog, we'll be diving into societal issues and examining slices of life in Singapore, from housing, education, and the prevalence of greenery to the best dim sum places. While Hong Kong and San Francisco (countries where I've lived) serve as countries of comparison in my blog, my content aims to be applicable to expats of all countries and locals in Singapore. Whether you are planning a move to Singapore, figuring out the best way to settle in as an expat, simply interested in life in Singapore, curious about how I perceive this beautiful nation, or just curious about my life's journey, this blog will be the perfect place for you.

I hope this blog provides a little insight into each of these havens and helps those who are exploring a move to Singapore.

Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss more.
