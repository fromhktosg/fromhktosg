----
-
-Welcome to my blog, a place where I share my perspective and experience of living as an expat in Singapore. You've arrived at the ideal destination for tips and tricks on expat living in Singapore.
-
-I'm a Hong Konger in his late 20s who has been living in Singapore for the past 5 years. I've wanted to start this blog for a while, but various reasons delayed its creation, with the primary one being "I haven't been in Singapore long enough." As someone who likes to observe and absorb, I always felt there was more to take in before drawing any respectable conclusions. This is especially pertinent when it comes to comparing cities. A city's fabric and texture change over time, and needless to say, Singapore and Hong Kong (two places where I've spent a lot of time) have changed immensely.
-
-As I hit my 5-year mark in Singapore, I felt now was a good time to share. Perhaps there is some magic to this nicely rounded number, or maybe it feels like both places have calmed down after the past few years of chaos. After all, Covid has been relegated to 'just another flu,' travel is back, and interest rates are up. Heck, even Lindsay Lohan is back to making movies.
-
-In this blog, we'll be diving into societal issues and examining slices of life in Singapore, from housing, education, and the prevalence of greenery to the best dim sum places. While Hong Kong and San Francisco (countries where I've lived) serve as countries of comparison in my blog, my content aims to be applicable to expats of all countries and locals in Singapore. Whether you are planning a move to Singapore, figuring out the best way to settle in as an expat, simply interested in Singapore living, curious about how I perceive this beautiful nation, or just curious about my life's journey, this blog will be the perfect place for you.
-
-I hope this blog provides a little insight into each of these havens and helps those who are exploring a move to Singapore or will be moving to Singapore.
-
-Best regards,
-

-My manager has always told me to underpromise and overdeliver. Hence, here's a list of what you can expect from my blog.
-
-+ I will post once a week. Either Wednesday and Saturday is what I’m thinking at the moment. I used to post twice a week but things got busy. If things become more free, I'll be back to posting twice a week
-+ I will share in different content formats. Listicles, op-eds, reflections… all possible
-+ My thoughts are my own. I am not representing my company, my friends or my ‘culture'
-+ I will avoid politics. This is going to be difficult, given politics is so intertwined with a city’s development and socio-economic issues. I will do my best
-+ I will compare countries. Mostly Hong Kong and Singapore. Occasionally the US as well. As much as the comparisons will be grounded in data, extrapolations and conclusions will be my own. You may disagree with me and I welcome that - just be respectful
-+ I will be honest. There are things that I love about Singapore and other things that I detest. I'll provide my honest opinion about expat living here
-+ I will try to help. The goal of this blog is to 1)help those who are considering a move to Singapore and 2)help those in Singapore to better settle in and thrive. It'll benefit expats in Singapore as well as locals in Singapore. Please reach out if you have specific questions and I’ll be happy to discuss further
-
-This might evolve. In due time.

-title:  "How I ended up moving to Singapore"
-categories: [Relocation, San Francisco]
-image: assets/images/relocationfromsf.jpg
----
-I've been in Singapore for 5 years and have been an expat who moved to the country from the US. Here's a little about my story - 
-
-I left Hong Kong to the States in the early 2010s for College and was lucky enough to find a job at a reputable tech firm post-graduation. I had an incredible time living in San Francisco - burritos in the Mission, morning walks at the Presidio, you name it. Yet, I knew staying in the US was not something I wanted to do long term. Here are the reasons why:
-
-+ I was bored. Life in the Bay area was very chill, but after staying there for 5 years, I felt the desire to ‘go next’. I was eager to explore other countries and was young enough to afford it
-
-+ I did not feel safe. San Francisco has a serious [homelessness](https://sfgov.org/scorecards/safety-net/homeless-population#:~:text=POINT%2DIN%2DTIME%20HOMELESS%20COUNTS,homeless%20population%20from%202019%20%E2%80%93%202022.) problem. Walking home past 9pm was not an option, which is ironic as something that basic is what we take for granted in Hong Kong or Singapore. SF is also extremely filthy. For those who’ve been to Embarcadero, Market Street or took the BART, you know the City reeks of piss. Very disturbing for such a wealthy place
-
-+ Immigration is a bitch. I went through the F1 → OPT → H-1B process and actually made it through the lottery ([~40% chance in 2019](https://www.lawfirm4immigrants.com/what-h-1b-lottery-results-says-about-odds/)). The process was an absolute nightmare littered with bureaucracy and uncertainty. Even with the gift of a H-1B, I knew I did not want to stay. Trump’s administration made things tricky and it just wasn’t the best time for immigration. I knew things would continue to be complicated until I received a Green Card which I had no intention of obtaining. Why? To the next point…
-
-+ Taxes are high and healthcare is expensive. Federal tax was ~25% and state tax was another 10%. Throw in a bunch of jargon like deductions, withholdings, Medicare, social security - it was all too overwhelming. The same applied to healthcare. I never understood why US healthcare is not free and public - it’s capitalism at its worst
-
-+ The commute to the South Bay was a waste of time. I traveled from SF to the South Bay Mon- Thurs every week on my company’s shuttles. On average, I took the 6:50AM shuttle to arrive at 8AM and the 4:30PM shuttle to arrive at 6:00PM. As much as I killed time through napping / working / watching YouTube, spending 2.5 hours on the road every week day was not productive
-
-| ![Hazy days]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/relocationfromsf.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Hazy days*  |
-
-Did I have Singapore set firmly in mind as the location to move to? No. Growing up, Singapore was just another Southeast Asian country. A 陽光海灘 (translation - sunny beach) location. Unassuming. I went there a few times as a child for vacation, and frankly speaking, I can’t remember anything about the place. So how did the shift to Singapore come about?
-
-+ I was offered an incredible job opportunity. My company program allowed for transfers to different countries, and Singapore was our APAC hub. The APAC market was growing rapidly, thus a slew of roles with amazing career prospects opened up. Whilst Hong Kong is similarly international and expat-friendly, there were a limited number of tech opportunities. This was also a key factor of why I did not consider moving back to Hong Kong.
-
-+ My relationship. I liked what I had with my then partner and wanted to continue our journey together. She had moved to Singapore to pursue further studies so being someone practical, I had to move in order to continue the relationship. Unsolicited advice to all my readers - never move to a country solely for your partner. Always have other reasons to supplement as if your relationship doesn’t work out, you’ll be beating yourself up
-
-+ Singapore is closer to family. I prefer a 4 hour flight from Singapore to Hong Kong than a 15 hour flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong
-
-Add these two lists of reasons together, and it was enough to pull me to Singapore. Looking back, I am extremely glad I made the decision to come over, and many other reasons have been added to the ‘Why Singapore’ list. Think taxes, safety, healthcare, travel opportunities, convenience. All components of great Singapore living. I’ll unpack these another day.
-
-Whilst the transition was relatively smooth, it did not come with its own set of apprehensions. For all those expats who moved to Singapore, what is your story? I'd love to know why you relocated, be it moving to Singapore for work or moving to Singapore for family. Subscribe now to find out in my next post.

-title:  "My top 5 concerns before moving to Singapore"
-categories: [Relocation, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/top5concerns.jpg
----
-
-In my last [post](https://fromhktosg.github.io/relocating-to-Singapore/), I talked about the push and pull factors that culminated in my move to Singapore. Whilst those reasons undeniably formed a strong case, I did have my fair share of reservations before moving over as an expat. These concerns came from various sources - government / company data, conversations with colleagues who moved over, local Singaporeans I knew, research online (cough, hardwarezone) and two earlier visits to the country in the year of the move. The reasons are as follows:
-
-1. A 40% salary pay cut
-
-    Moving from San Francisco to Singapore entailed a 40% non-negotiable salary cut - ouch.The cut is driven by the discrepancy in cost of labour, with Singapore being much cheaper than SF. Even with cost of living and tax adjusted for, I calculated a ~15-18% decrease in net income with the move. Equity refresh amounts were also ~30% lower which is a big hit to overall compensation. It took me an additional 1.5 years in Singapore and a promotion with the company to arrive back at my US starting pay as a fresh graduate
-
-2. The weather’s hot and humid
-
-    Hong Kong is hot and humid in the summer but chilly in the winter. SF is cool and crisp all year round with mild winters. Singapore is annoyingly hot and humid all year round, with temperatures easily reaching 30 degrees celsius on any given day (even in December). Seasons do not exist and rain is unpredictable. I thought I’d acclimate well with the heat given Hong Kong has a similar summer climate but I was very wrong. On top of that, Singapore has an additional variant of dust mite (look up blomia tropicalis) which is a nuisance for those with dust allergies like myself
-
-3. Singapore’s tiny and boring
-
-    With an approximate area of [720km²](https://www.worlddata.info/asia/singapore/index.php#:~:text=Singapore%20is%20an%20island%20state,size%20of%20New%20York%20City.), Singapore is smaller than New York City. There’s really not much to do in such a small landmass, hence you’ll see a constant stream of people (particularly expats) venturing out to nearby SEA countries for escapes. There’s a limited amount of nature and altitude on the island (an article for another time) which vastly reduces outdoor opportunities. If you ask what locals do on the weekends, you’ll get the same mix of answers between the ‘mall’, ‘netflix’, and ‘eat out’. Nothing wrong with any of those options but it’s not the most exciting and gets repetitive. To be fair, a small landmass also does not directly translate to boredom (Hong Kong being the best example), but onto my next point…

-
-4. Singapore feels artificially constructed
-
-    Whilst Lee Kuan Yew’s development of Singapore is an economic masterclass, the country’s modernity came with a laser focus on progress versus preservation in the 60s/70s. Examples include prioritization on standardized housing vs maintaining [kampungs](https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/kampung-life-the-last-villages-in-singapore-and-the-stories-behind-them), as well as emphasis on sciences, business, law academically vs the arts. It’s no surprise that this approach was correct and essential to take Singapore to its current world stature, but also resulted in the ‘cultural desert’(https://www.jstor.org/stable/4488510) it was 20 years back, with lingering effects to the present. What I appreciate is that the Singapore government is aware of such shortcomings and has doubled down on integrating the arts into society. All that being said, Singapore’s latest and meticulous developments (from parks to commercial estates to cafes) feel artificial or constructed for Instagram. Whilst the intent is there, the impact may be lacking. On the other hand, Hong Kong has struck more of a balance between development and [preservation](https://www.bbc.com/storyworks/capital/city-of-inspiration/heritage), with its unique heritage interweaving itself across the newer metropolitan landscape. Definitely something for Singapore to learn from. 
-

-    |:--:| 
-    |  *The Marina skyline*  |
-
-5. Strict laws, over-regulation and censorship
-
-    Singapore has one of the strictest laws of any country. Examples include banning the sale of chewing gum, needing a license for public demonstration, LGBT censorship and prohibiting borrowing your neighbour’s wifi. Capital punishment is legal and caning is a form of corporal punishment. This is extremely unsettling as it feels like one wrong step will have you deported. There’s a lot to unpack around this topic, but after 5 years, I do think there are a lot of merits to Singapore’s strict regime, with the primary one being stability of the country.
-
-Looking back on this list, the first two worries are very valid, whilst the last three have a lot more nuance to them. Other concerns have emerged along the way (Singapore’s a bubble, everything is getting ridiculously expensive), whilst many more have been debunked. All that being said, moving to Singapore and living the expat life here has been amazing.

-title:  "Singapore PR in my first attempt! Come learn the secrets in my guide"
-categories: [Relocation, Immigration, PR]
-image: assets/images/sgpr.jpg
----
-Let’s begin with the obvious disclaimer - I’m not a lawyer. However, I did manage to become a Singapore permanent resident in just one attempt so I’ll be sharing my take on the application process and some tips and tricks I learnt along the way. Before you apply for your PR, do be aware of the benefits and drawbacks of living in Singapore - I cover some of this in my last post [here](https://fromhktosg.github.io/top-concerns/).
-
-One thing I’ll say upfront - don’t bother with immigration agencies. They’re expensive with limited upside and sell you on weird gimmicks like PR success calculators. All my friends who engaged with one regretted their decision and failed to get residency. It’s not a stat sig sample size but it’s telling. Let’s start off with the basics.
-
-#### What does Singapore permanent residency (PR) mean?
-
-Singapore PR is an immigration status that allows individuals to live, work and study in Singapore without a set time limit (though there is a little more nuance to this, as discussed later in the post). There are approximately [520K](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/population-and-population-structure/latest-data) PRs in Singapore, making up 9% of the total population. Annually, there’s a [~30K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency_in_Singapore) cap on the number of PRs granted, with an estimated 100K applications.
-
-
-#### What are the different ways to get Singapore permanent residency?
-
-There are 3 main tracks to get Singapore PR. These exclude students applying, or Singapore citizens / PRs applying for their parents / spouse.
-
-1. Global Investor Program ([GIP](https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/how-we-help/global-investor-programme.html))
-
-    [Apply for PR](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/singapore-global-investor-programme-higher-investment-quantum-3317416) by 1) investing $10 million in starting a business, 2) investing $25 million in GIP-selected funds, 3) set up a Singapore-based single family office with at least $200 million AUM. From 2020 - 2022, [~200 PR applications](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/about-200-individuals-granted-pr-status-through-global-investor-programme-3298491) were approved from the GIP track. Pretty easy for anyone who has money to throw around.
-
-2. Foreign Artistic Talent scheme
-
-    For those who are talented and can meet all the minimum requirements [below](https://www.nac.gov.sg/support/capability-development/leadership-career-and-artistic-development/foreign-artistic-talent-scheme-(forarts)):
-    + ‘Possess relevant training/education in your field of practice
-    + Possess relevant professional experience, with outstanding achievements, in the field of Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Literary Arts, Design and/or Media
-    + Have made significant contributions to Singapore’s arts and cultural scene, including a strong track record of local engagements at leadership level
-    + Have concrete future plans to be involved in Singapore’s arts and cultural sector’
- 
-    Probably not for most plebeians.
-
-3. Professionals/Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers Scheme (PTS)
-
-    This is the majority track, for those with Employment Passes (EPs) to apply for PR. I applied through this method as evidently, I did not have the money or artistic talent.
-
-What’s important to note is that ‘main applicants who are granted PR status under the [Professionals/Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers Scheme or the Investor Scheme](https://www.ica.gov.sg/reside/PR/apply), are exempted from National Service’. Hurrah.
-
-#### Why apply for PR and what benefits does it provide?
-
-
-##### Stay in the country without restrictions
-The most important factor in my POV. In this current layoff climate, PR has emerged as a strong reassurance for those who want to stay in the country. Additionally, you can apply for long term visit passes (LTVPs) for your parents if they want to stay in Singapore for a while.
-
-
-##### Job opportunity advantages
-This manifests in threefold. First, the government has regulations that ensure citizens and PRs have priority to job opportunities. ‘Employers are required to [advertise a job position](https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/employment-pass/what-changes-to-my-job-advertisement-in-jobs-bank-will-require-me-to-extend-it-for-another-14-days-before-i-can-apply-for-an-ep) for 14 days’ before they can apply for an Employment Pass for that position. Second, an employment pass only allows you to perform your full time job whilst a PR allows you to dabble in other income-making ventures. Third, job retraining benefits are provided to upskill / if you are retrenched (Singapore’s way of addressing unemployment).
-
-
-##### Buy HDB resale flats
-Not the biggest factor for most, with a multitude of [caveats](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-guides/how-do-singapore-permanent-residents-buy-a-hdb-flat-9914). A single PR is not eligible to buy a HDB resale flat either.
-
-##### CPF contribution
-401K (US) / MPF (HK) equivalent to a pension fund. A plus and a minus. It does help with savings and provides stable interest rates, but most are better off investing that money elsewhere with higher returns.
-
-##### Eligible for Singapore citizenship
-PR is the stepping stone to Singapore citizenship. Great for those with weak passports or those who want to settle in the country long term.
-
-| ![SGPR]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sgpr.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *I wouldn't mind permanently seeing this sunset*  |
-
-#### What are the drawbacks of Singapore PR?
-
-Two primary ones:
-
-1. PRs are subject to Re-Entry Permit ([REP](https://www.ica.gov.sg/reside/PR/apply-REP)) requirements if they wish to leave Singapore for any length of time
-
-    REPs are required to re-enter Singapore. They expire every 5 years, so despite PR providing a path to stay in the country on paper, REP is what really determines whether you keep your Singapore PR. Renewal factors include whether you are paying taxes, working in Singapore etc. This ensures those with PR status are actually present in and contributing to Singapore.
-
-2. National service liability
-    The true bogeyman in the room. ‘[Male applicants](https://www.ica.gov.sg/reside/PR/apply) who are granted PR status as a Foreign Student or under their parents’ sponsorship are required to register for NS upon reaching 16½ years old and will be scheduled for enlistment at the earliest opportunity upon reaching 18 years old’. Be it on a safety or best use of time standpoint, this is the main deterrent for applying to PR amongst my peer group.
-
-#### What are the factors of a successful PR applicant?
-
-Here is a checklist based off successful PR applications I know:
-
-+ Professional experience: Having a well-reputed and well-paying job that fills a talent gap in Singapore helps (i.e. R&D, tech). It shows that you are able to contribute to Singapore’s economy both from a talent and taxes standpoint
-
-+ Education level: The higher the better (at least a Bachelor’s degree). You’re competing against the best so I’d think this is a must
-
-+ Age: Younger the better given an aging population
-
-+ Duration of stay: No hard and fast rule but I’d recommend those who are applying to have spent 2+ years in the country. It shows commitment and integration
-
-+ Integration with Singapore society: The most important factor in my POV given Singapore’s emphasis on harmony. Immigration agencies recommend applicants to donate or volunteer time to show they care about local causes and individuals. Whilst I don’t think it’s necessary, it’s part of the integration angle
-
-So why is getting PR such a difficult ordeal? The high volume of applicants is one. Some also say there are quotas based on racial [proportions](https://www.gov.sg/article/what-are-the-racial-proportions-among-singapore-citizens) that mirror Singapore’s societal composition, given ‘the proportions of each race in Singapore’s citizen population have remained stable’ across twenty years. However, there is no concrete data around quotas based on race, hence nor will I speculate.
-
-#### My own PR application experience
-
-I applied for PR during the COVID days in Feb 2020. The process took nine months (avg time on ICA’s website is 6 months) and I was notified of the results in Nov 2020.
-
-My personal credentials and success factors based off the checklist above are -
-+ Business role in a large tech company with stellar track record of performance and trajectory
-+ Bachelor's degree in a top 25 degree university in the world
-+ Late 20s without children
-+ Stayed in the country for 2.5 years
-+ Cantonese-speaking and from HK (helps with integration I assume?). **This is one advantage I see HK people have given the similarities between both locations**
-
-As part of my application, I also attached a few value-add documents to help myself stand out. Whilst there isn’t a formal space for value-add documents, just upload these docs in any open file slots in the application. These docs include:
-+ **Cover letter** - my background, why Singapore and how I can contribute and integrate to society
-+ **2 letters of recommendation from Singapore citizens** - how we know each other, why I’ll be good for the country
-+ **Resume** - my professional qualifications and academic background
-
-Others also attach their awards or volunteer certifications but I didn’t have any of that. Feel free to reach out to me for a copy of my cover letter and references. 
-
-I was one happy trooper when I found out my application was successful. I had low expectations anyway. I’ll end by saying if your application is not successful, just try again after a year, but make sure there’s a material change in your application when you reapply i.e. change in jobs, family status. 
-
-Best of luck in your PR applications and reach out if you have any questions. Subscribe to see more similar content like this

-title:  "3 essentials that make Singapore successful"
-categories: [Singapore, housing, food]
-image: assets/images/sdg.png
----
-In 1991, the Singapore government introduced [five shared values](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/62f98f76-d54d-415d-93a1-4561c776ab97#:~:text=The%20five%20Shared%20Values%20that,5%20Racial%20and%20religious%20harmony). that helped forge a Singaporean identity. These values include 
-
-a) nation before community and society above self
-
-b) family as the basic unit of society
-
-c) community support and respect for the individual
-
-d) consensus, not conflict 
-
-e) racial and religious harmony
-
-Aspirational and idealistic stuff.
-
-Whilst these values still ring true today, I attribute the crux of Singapore’s success to three key factors. I call these the ‘3 Hs’, each of which address a basic human need and culminates to the bedrock of Singapore’s society. They are -
-
-1. Housing - I have a place to live
-
-2. Hawkers - I have affordable food
-
-3. Harmony - I am safe
-
-All three of these show up in UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals (#s 2, 9, 10, 11) and culminates into one last important ‘H’ for every nation - ‘hope’.

-|  *Source: [UNDP SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)*  |
-
-Let’s dive into each and compare how they fare versus the situation in Hong Kong. For what it’s worth, we’ll save deeper analysis for each factor another time. For what it's worth, many of these benefits are available for expats as well as locals (PRs and citizens), though with more benefits for the latter. If you're wondering what the PR process is like, check out my last post [here](https://fromhktosg.github.io/top-concerns/).
-
-#### Housing
-
-Despite ruffles in the past 5 years on rising housing prices, Singapore’s public housing system is a best-in-class example of putting a roof on top of everyone’s head. In fact, the World Bank has lauded Singapore for building the [best public housing program in the world](https://blogs.worldbank.org/sustainablecities/what-about-singapore-lessons-best-public-housing-program-world).
-
-Public housing in Singapore (also called HDBs) began as the government’s way of improving living conditions as the population grew in the 40s (https://www.jstor.org/stable/43621881). Government policies pushed for property ownership, and this ownership of property translated to social stability and eventually into an asset-owning class. TLDR, it’s an ownership into Singapore’s future and prosperity.  
-
-We won’t be examining public housing minutiae (BTOs, resales, development locations), private housing or the rental market today, but I’d like to highlight the table below as it tells all between public housing in Singapore versus Hong Kong.
-
-|     | Singapore | Hong Kong  |
-| :---        |    :----:   | :---: |
-| % of citizens with home ownership      | [90%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-27/how-much-will-singapore-rents-rise-surging-prices-put-expats-under-pressure#:~:text=Singapore%20abolished%20rent%20controls%20in,Ministry%20of%20National%20Development%20said.)       | [50%](https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-publications/english/2021rb02-socioeconomic-implications-of-home-ownership-for-hong-kong-20210301-e.pdf)     |
-| % in public housing   | [80%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/966747/population-living-in-public-housing-singapore/)     | [45%](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2182106/why-public-housing-shortfall-will-remain-thorn-hong-kongs)      |
-| Income ceiling   | $14K SGD / month / household ($10.4K USD)| [$30.9K HKD / month / family of four](https://www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/flat-application/income-and-asset-limits/index.html) ($3.9K USD)|
-
-90% of Singaporean citizens own homes versus 50% of Hong Kong citizens, reflecting the difference in accessibility over various housing opportunities. If we hone in on public housing, the divide grows between both countries. In fact, it showcases Singapore’s commitment to create a minimum quality of living where housing is a universal need. This becomes even more apparent when we cut into the income ceiling for new public housing, with Singapore’s ceiling being 2.6X higher than that of Hong Kong’s. Whilst HK public housing clearly focuses on the lowest income families due to limited supply, the intention and ideology behind committing to a minimum quality of living is missing, further reflected by a high gini coefficient.
-
-#### Hawkers
-
-Resolving hunger ensures a healthier and more productive nation. Singapore’s solution to this is through hawker centers.
-
-What was once a method to provide organized space and increase hygiene standards for street hawkers has now emerged as an integral way of Singaporean life that is recognized on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Hawker centers bring well known-local foods of all ethnicities together at an extremely affordable price. 5 years ago, an average chicken rice or bak chor mee (noodles) was priced at $3-3.5 SGD. Nowadays, it nets out at around $5. This is arguably cheaper than cooking on your own unless you’re doing it in bulk, hence why [~25%](https://www.posist.com/restaurant-times/singapore/singapore-foodevolution.html) of Singaporeans dine out daily. 
-
-Hong Kong does have its equivalents, be it cha chaan tengs (茶餐廳), dai pai dongs (大排檔) and cooked food centers (街市熟食中心). Whilst prices are at $7 which is still affordable for the masses, it is a 40% increase vs. Singapore. Given median household incomes are similar between both countries, Singapore trumps with affordability. 
-
-#### Harmony
-
-For the sake of simplification, I’m defining ‘harmony’ here as ‘I am safe given who I am and in the environment I am in’. This can be on a racial, religious and physical danger standpoint. Whilst ensuring harmony has by no means been perfect, the government has put in meticulous policies to strive for safety and social cohesion. Some examples of this include maintaining CMIO quotas over time (racial composition between Chinese, Malay, Indian, Others), embedding public housing all across Singapore (beyond rural areas) and ensuring every major race and religion have two public holidays each. As for Hong Kong, let’s just say it’s been a little shaky in recent times. 
-
----
-
-With the above 3 Hs, they also contribute to ‘hope’ for the nation. These 3Hs have laid down the bedrock of Singapore’s path to success, and despite various challenges along the way, its strong foundations will remain a competitive advantage for the country.

-I’ll be switching gears in my next post to discuss a topic of similar magnitude - finding the best dim sum places in Singapore. Subscribe now so you don’t miss out!

-title:  "Hong Kong local reviews the best dim sum in Singapore"
-categories: [Food]
-image: assets/images/dimsumjade.jpg
----
-One of the implicit duties as a Hong Konger is to have deep knowledge of the best dim sum places. I truly believe those who have grown up in Hong Kong have the best palettes to discern between good, average and bad dim sum. Is the har gao skin too thick or clammy? Is the soy sauce too salty or sweet? Is the oil not drained properly from the spring rolls? These are all questions that go through my head when enjoying a dim sum meal. I’m no arbiter of the tradition, but I do want to call out dim sum restaurants that excel in its trade. The good thing is that Singapore is filled with good dim sum places, so let’s deep dive into what’s on my good list and what’s on my blacklist.
-
-#### My taste test at all dim sum places
-
-I prefer savoury to sweet food options. Hence, excuse my lack of consumption of sweeter dim sums.
-
-1. Tea
- A must-have to cleanse the palette from oilier foods. Good tea should have clean flavours and strong aromas
-2. Shiu mai / Siu mai / Siew mai (燒賣, steamed pork and shrimp dumpling)
- A Cantonese classic. Size of shrimp and correct ratio between pork and shrimp matters
-3. Har gao (蝦餃, shrimp dumpling)
- Another Cantonese classic. Lots of factors come into play for this one, including the size of shrimp, thickness of skin, seasoning of the filling
-4. Beef balls (牛肉球)
- One of my favourite dim sums. Assessment criteria include the amount of flour in the minced beef, addition of dried mandarin orange and retention of meat juices
-5. Steamed pork ribs (蒸排骨)
- Best with garlic and black beans. Too much flour when marinating will make the pork ribs lose its meatiness and too small of a pork rib will leave the diner wanting for more
-6. Barbeque pork buns (叉燒包)
- A worthy test given its complexities. Fluffiness of the bun and seasoning of the cha siu mix matter.
-
----
-
-On to the list you all are waiting for -
-
-#### $$ range - Solid options that are worthy for weekly weekend visits
-
-##### Tim Ho Wan - the OG from Hong Kong
-
-Location: [Store list](https://www.timhowan.com/our-stores/)
-
-Tim Ho Wan is a cult classic in Hong Kong. Its founding chefs worked in Lung King Heen (3 Michelin star cantonese restaurant at the Four Seasons) before starting their own dim sum establishment. Within a year of opening, the original THW store in Mong Kok was awarded with a Michelin star. THW has since expanded across Singapore, with over 12 stores across the island (most likely franchised). Whilst the menu in Singapore is slightly different than that of Hong Kong’s, quality remains consistent.
-
-Must try: Baked BBQ Pork Buns (酥皮焗叉烧包): A rendition of Hong Kong’s classic barbeque pork buns, but with a pastry crust (akin to that of a pineapple bun)
-
-#### Canton paradise - Local and reliable chain
-
-Location: [Store list](https://www.paradisegp.com/restaurant-locator/?Locate=Canton%20Paradise)
-
-Cantonese arm of the local chain Paradise Group. Scattered across the island, the restaurant serves quality Hong Kong dishes, with dim sum and roast meats being some of its highlights. Whilst ambiance may be a mixed bag, the quality of food rarely disappoints. P.S., if you are an employee of the Paradise Group for over 10 years, you get a [free rolex](https://mothership.sg/2023/03/paradise-group-rolex/). Pog.
-
-Must try: Stir-fried Carrot Cake in XO sauce (XO酱炒萝卜糕). A different carrot cake to those you find in a hawker store. I’m a sucker for XO sauce so this one is addictive.
-

-|:--:| 
-|  *Snapshot of the menu*  |
-
-#### Treasures yi dian xin - Sunday staple
-Location: [Store list](https://www.imperialtreasure.com/restaurants)
-
-Don’t mix this up with the One dim sum restaurant (一點心) in Hong Kong, or the Yi Dian Xin in a hawker center (see my last [post](https://fromhktosg.github.io/stablenation/)). The restaurant is part of the Imperial Treasures group and similar to Canton Paradise, it serves authentic and reliable dim sum. If I’m in the Orchard area on a Sunday, this would be my go-to.
-
-Must try: Steamed pork ribs (豉汁蒸排骨). Simple, well-marinated and juicy.
-
-Legendary HK - Cha chaan teng x dim sum
-
-Location: [Store list](https://lhk.com.sg/) but would recommend the [OG store](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Legendary+Hong+Kong+Restaurant+%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E5%82%B3%E5%A5%87%E9%A4%90%E5%BB%B3/@1.3394886,103.7052064,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe9ef409f45cc108e?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6k_fb_dj9AhV-DLcAHaX6DxMQ_BJ6BQiCARAI) in Boon Lay 
-
-My favorite everyday cantonese diner in Singapore by a mile. Whilst my go-to at Legendary HK is always rice / noodle dishes, their dim sum is unassumingly good. In fact, you can watch them make the dim sums through a glass paned window near the entrance of the restaurant. If I ever want a taste of home, Legendary is my default.
-
-Must try: Any of the congees (粥). Their congees are large in portion, extremely fluffy (棉) and filled with flavour

-
-### $$$ range - Above and beyond locations that never disappoint with an upscale experience
-
-#### Wah Lok - Affordable luxury
-
-Location: [Carlton hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wah+Lok+Cantonese+Restaurant/@1.2959685,103.852255,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x31da19a45dd5379f:0x8a332c8a2e199fe9!8m2!3d1.2959685!4d103.852255!16s%2Fg%2F1tf40glq)
-
-Nestled in the Carlton hotel, Wah Lok is an old time establishment that has stood the test of times and comparably, is not that much more expensive than the usual dim sum chains. Its baos and dumplings are plump and succulent. It’s fried rice not oily with each granule of rice clearly separated. For its reputation and quality, I consider Wah Lok’s dim sum menu an absolute value steal.
-
-Must try: Shrimp dumpling (蝦餃) - the best in Singapore given the enormous shrimp size and thin outer Salted fish chicken fried rice (鹹魚雞粒炒飯) - may be specific to only Chinese New Year but order it if you have a chance. It’s wok hei is unparalleled.
-
-#### Jiang Nan Chun - High end luxury
-
-Location: [Four Seasons hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jiang-Nan+Chun/@1.3051922,103.8284188,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xf27b51293cfa7bd2?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnhLONgtn9AhXOTmwGHTD3DrIQ_BJ6BAh-EAg)
-
-On one random Sunday, I decided to visit this restaurant and ordered every single dim sum on the menu alongside a few starters. Jiang Nan Chun had  one michelin star back then and it sure did not disappoint. Its service was best-in-class, with high quality tea and delicate candied vegetables served on the outset. Whilst all of its dim sums were solid, I thought the steamed items were more memorable than the fried ones.
-
-Must try: Barbeque pork (叉燒) - it’s not a dim sum item but I think JNC has the best barbeque pork in Singapore. Slightly burnt, juicy, not overly soft, thick. I hate it when Singapore hawkers slice their barbeque pork thinly. JNC does just the opposite and provides you with a slab of heaven. Steamed lobster and scallop dumpling (龍蝦帶子餃) - quality ingredients wrapped around a delicate rice skin. What’s not to like?
-
-#### Jade - My go-to dim sum ‘buffet’
-
-Location: [The Fullerton hotel](https://www.fullertonhotels.com/fullerton-hotel-singapore/dining/restaurants-and-bars/jade)
-
-$58 per pax for a 15 item dim sum fiesta. It’s not really a buffet as you can’t order the same dish twice and you’re capped to 15 dishes. However, Jade serves authentic Cantonese food with a modern twist. Most hit the mark, including the Deep-fried taro with cod and chinese peppercorns
-
-Must try: Braised bird’s nest and truffled egg white in superior broth (红烧菘露蛋白蟹肉燕窝羹) - thick, rich and full of umami. Lobster meat porridge (深海龙虾粥) - chunky, flavourful and fluffy.
-
-What to avoid: Barbeque pork, crispy lobster dumpling and seasonal veggies

-
-### My blacklist
-There are a few places that I feel are overhyped, overpriced or too gimmicky. To glaze over the reasons: 
-
-+ Swee Choon - Overhyped, very mediocre, average ingredients
-+ MASA by black society - Style over substance, too fusion
-+ Madame fan - Overpriced, catered for foreigners
-
-I’d preface I have not tried dim sums at the hawker centers before. What other dim sum recommendations do you guys have? Let me know your favourite dim sum in Singapore so I can try it out. Those on my list are Red Star dim sum, Sum dim sum and Dim Sum Haus. Subscribe now so you won’t miss out on the next post.

-title:  "Guide to getting your Singapore driving license in one try"
-categories: [Driving, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/road.jpg
----
-My father always insisted that I get a driving license. Back in his days, it was a way to have a job, as truck / taxi driving could always get you a basic paycheck. Obviously, times have changed since then. Driving in Singapore has never been essential given that the [public transit system](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/getting_around/public_transport/rail_network.html) is so robust. However, for those who are looking to drive, obtaining a Singapore driving license is a little tricky. Modeled after Japan’s driving examination system, Singapore’s driving exam is notoriously difficult to pass. Today, I’ll unpack how to get a driving license and share how I passed my examination (barely) on the first try.
-
-#### What is the process of getting a qualified driving license (QDL)?
-
-The legal driving age for Singapore is 18. For most people, a Class 3 or a Class 3A driver’s license which ‘allows you to drive motor cars of unladen weight not exceeding 3000 kg with not more than 7 passengers, exclusive of the driver’ is sufficient. 
-
-<u> For those with a foreign driving license… <u>
-
-…the process is quite simple. From the traffic police website -
-
-1. Pass the Basic Theory Test (BTT) at any of the driving centers in Singapore;
-2. Possess a valid qualified foreign driving license
-3. Possess an extract of the driving license record from the Licensing Authority (basically an international driving's license), indicating the date of first issue of the foreign driving license and the date of expiry of the driving license
-4. Possess a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)
-
-<u> For those without a foreign driving license… <u>
-
-… it’s a bit more drawn out.
-1. Register at a driving center
-2. Pass an eye and colour test
-3. Pass the Basic Theory Test (BTT): 50 questions, 50 minutes, 45/50 to pass
-4. Pass the Final Theory Test (FTT):  50 questions, 50 minutes, 45/50 to pass; only after you pass your BTT
-5. Begin on-road driving classes: at a driving school or through private classes
-6. Complete three driving simulator sessions: only after 5 on-road classes. These simulators are like the driving games you get in arcades except they’re miles slower and a lot more educational
-7. Pass the Practical Driving Test (PDT). Assessment components include -
-    a) Circuit test: Complete various stations at a designated circuit to test parallel parking, vertical parking, directional change, emergency stop, moving up slope, moving up a ramp, navigating a crank course, navigating a S-course. There’s no specific ordering for these stations - it’s dependent on the traffic conditions inside the circuit
-    b) Road test: Drive on-road to test steering control, road etiquette, lane change and u-turns
-
-| ![Learning to drive]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/driving.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Source: Learning to drive*  |
-
-Note: If you fail your circuit test, you won’t make it on the public roads for the rest of the examination
-
-#### Should I go private or opt for a driving school?
-
-This is the million dollar question. Plenty of cost analyses have been done (this is a good one by GetGo) so I am not going to go through one. However, I’ll highlight a couple of things to be aware of.
-
-<u> Driving schools <u>
-
-Three main driving schools in Singapore
-1. Comfort DelGro Driving Center (CDC) - in Ubi (the East)
-2. Singapore Safety Driving Center (SSDC) - in Woodlands (the North)
-3. Bukit Batok Driving Center (BBDC) - in Bukit Batok (the West)
-
-All these schools are near the outskirts of town (given space is required for a driving center), so expect a commute if you live centrally.
-
-Pros
-+ Structured curriculum for those learning from fresh
-+ Easy booking access to circuit training
-+ Higher pass rates for first timers
-
-Cons
-+ Pricier than private in most cases
-+ Structured curriculum equates to more time investment per class
-+ Need to fight for driving time slots in the school booking portal
-
-<u> Private <u>
-
-Singapore has a dwindling population of private driving instructors as the Traffic Police has stopped issuing driving instructor licenses. However, they weren’t too hard to find (I found mine through this site). I reached out to a couple of instructors and decided on one that I felt the most comfortable with. More on my instructor later.
-
-Pros
-+ Flexible curriculum
-+ Flexible timing
-+ Driver can pick you up near your home
-+ Cheaper than driving school
-
-Cons
-+ Instructor standards may vary
-+ Advance booking required for circuit training
-
-#### My driving experience and how I miraculously passed my driving exam
-
-<u> Choosing private <u>
-
-I chose the private route as I already had experience driving. A few years prior to moving to Singapore, I took ~30 hours of driving lessons in the US. I even signed up for the driving test there, but failed miserably (and deservedly so, as I nearly hit another car). Given my ‘experience’ behind the wheel though, I thought going private is a much more flexible option. With a private instructor, I’d take a few classes to familiarize myself behind the wheel and practice driving on the left side of the road (US drives on the right) - sounds easy enough.
-
-<u> Choosing BBDC <u>
-
-I chose BBDC given its proximity to where I live. Their sign up portal is garbage. Remember to book in advance for registration, written tests and practical tests, as there’s generally a 1.5 months wait time. Do not worry about topping up a little more money than needed in your BBDC account. They’ll reimburse the excess once you pass your exam. I opted for a Class 3 driving license as I didn’t see a need for learning manual.
-
-<u> Passing my BTT and FTT <u>
-
-Don’t bother buying the study books for both tests. I studied way too much for these written exams and that’s time I’ll never get back. The easiest way to prepare is to search online for example questions (i.e. this practice exam site) and go through as many of them as possible. The questions are MC and mostly common sense but take your time and don’t feel rushed even if some 20 year old teen blows through it and passes in the first 5 minutes. Make sure to learn the road signs though - those will definitely come up. After your exam, you’ll know whether you passed right away. I made two exhaustive sets of study notes too so reach out if interested - I’m happy to share them.
-
-<u> Choosing an instructor <u>
-
-Mr Tan was an experienced instructor in his early 70s. He was reluctant to take me on as a student when I first reached out given he had a full roster of students. However, I managed to convince him given I had already passed by BTT. His rates were 1) $100 one time registration fee, 2) $60 for a 80 minute class, 3) $96 for a 80 minute class with circuit, 4) $300 car rental fee for examination. It’s probably higher now given inflation. I’d meet him in Bukit Gombak’s car park and he'd pick me up in his Mazda. He was a patient guy who gave practical driving tips along the way and I always felt safe in his car. I told him to scream at me if I was doing something inaccurate or stupid, and he had no problem doing so which I appreciated. I was a talkative guy and he entertained me at times, but overall, made sure I was focused on the road conditions.
-
-<u> Practicing for the exam <u>
-
-It didn’t take long for me to get my driving mojo back. We’d go through examination routes in the driving classes near BBDC, and we went to a makeshift car park near Choa Chu Kang to practice parking as well as S / crank courses. I was cruising on the road after a few classes, but the circuit was where I struggled with the most as it felt too hectic given there were people practicing and others taking their examination.
-I ended up visiting the circuit 5 times before taking my final examination. My instructor also gave me a checklist on how marks are deducted as well as a map of the circuit area so I can familiarize with how exam conditions will be.
-
-<u> Taking the exam <u>
-
-Probably the most nerve wracking experience in my life, more than any job interviews, exec presentations or sports competitions. For the day of the exam, I warmed up in my instructor’s car, then waited in the traffic police office for my examiner. A 200 pound man showed up, told me he was my examiner, then proceeded to squeeze into my little car. I started off the test well, but accidentally drove with my hand brakes on during a portion of the circuit. Silly me. I thought I failed at that moment, but the examiner didn’t say anything so I continued. I made it through the circuit, did my on-road test then circled back into the driving center. I waited 15 minutes in the traffic police office, and found out I passed! I had 18 demerit points - 20 was the failure mark and scoring is in increments of two. The examiner probably thought I was a safe and docile driver and went easy on me. I was obviously lucky but hey, we take those. 
-
-After I passed, I strolled to the BBDC counter and collected a document for my qualified driving license (QDL). It started pouring torrentially the moment I stepped out of the BBDC center - again, lucky
-
-<u> Key statistics of getting my drivers license <u>
-
-+ 6 months to get my license - I took my BTT on Apr 30th and passed my PDT on Nov 9th
-+ 16 hours of driving classes - I took twelve 80 minute classes overall including the warm up before my PDT
-+ $1430 spent - includes driving school registration, driving classes and car rental
-
-And that’s a wrap! I’ve driven a few times in Singapore and once abroad since I passed my exam. Public transportation is still my preferred mode of commute, but at least I have driving ticked off as a life skill. Do you need a car in Singapore? It depends. Some families insist on it. I personally don't think so because Singapore's so [small](https://fromhktosg.github.io/top-concerns/).  I recommend my friends to never sit in my car but realistically, I’m not that bad of a driver.

-In my earlier post, we talked about how hawker centers are the dining hall for all Singaporeans. Whilst that remains true, plenty of supermarket chains exist across the island. Today, we’ll unpack some of the common stores to visit and my go-tos for specific grocery items. For what it’s worth, we’ll focus on the physical stores today and save the discussion on online options later. Note - I’m a sucker for supermarkets. I love walking through all sorts of grocery stores, especially when abroad. You should also be excited too. In case you're someone who doesn't cook, don't worry, Singapore has plenty of good restaurants. Check out my dim sum list [here](https://fromhktosg.github.io/dimsum/).
-
-#### How does Singapore get its food?
-
-As a small island nation, Singapore relies heavily on imports to achieve food security. In fact, [90%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/21/singapore-imports-90percent-of-its-food-how-is-it-coping-with-inflation.html) of food in Singapore is imported. [Malaysia](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cna-explains-where-does-singapore-get-its-food-2709161#:~:text=One%20of%20Singapore%27s%20largest%20sources,Brazil%20than%20any%20other%20country) is one of the major suppliers for Singapore given it borders the country. Whilst Singapore is actively looking to diversify food supplying countries as well as [develop capacities](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming) for local food production, global economic and geo-political factors will always have a direct impact on food supply and pricing (example - what if [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_chicken_export_ban) banned the export of chicken?). P.S., I find it almost impossible to find a decent tomato in Singapore unless they’re atas and on the vine.
-
-#### What are the supermarket powerhouses?
-
-Four main staples in Singapore: Fairprice, Cold Storage, Sheng Shiong and Giant. Each supermarket chain has their respective loyalty programs and credit card partnerships (i.e. UOB x Cold Storage) so be on the lookout to maximize value.
-
-[Fairprice](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fairprice.com.sg/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1685069303740192&usg=AOvVaw0qUJwwsAvUbcTtmtdq5dBs)
-
-Largest retailer in Singapore (~100 stores) and is a cooperative of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). HK's equivalent will be Parknshop.
-
-Main sub-brands:
-+ Fairprice / fairprice shop (regular supermarket)
-+ Fairprice Xtra (groceries and household items)
-+ Fairprice Xpress (at Exxon petrol kiosks)
-+ Fairprice Finest (pricer but has wider assortment of imported products and feels more lux)
-+ Warehouse club (Singapore version of Costco. Don’t bother going to this - it’s in the middle of nowhere and there’s a limited assortment of international / Kirkland branded items)
-
-[Cold storage](https://coldstorage.com.sg/)
-
-50 odd stores around the country. HK’s equivalent is Welcome. A little more pricey with a lot of imported selections.
-
-Main sub-brands:
-+ Cold Storage (regular supermarket)
-+ Cold Storage fresh (upscaled experience)
-+ Jason’s Deli (more of a convenience store experience)
-
-[Sheng Shiong](https://shengsiong.com.sg/)
-
-Primarily in the heartlands. Not going to lie - I think I’ve stepped foot in one Sheng Shiong in my five years in Singapore. Prices seemed cheaper than Fairprice and Cold Storage (as substantiated in this article). I have no prejudice against Sheng Shiong - it’s just not close to where Ilive.
-
-[Giants Supermarket](https://giant.sg/)
-
-Hypermarket that came from Malaysia. Fantastic prices. Wide selections.
-
-Main sub-brands: Self explanatory
-+ Giant hypermarket
-+ Giant supermarket
-+ Giant express
-
-<u> How about Japanese / Chinese supermarket chains? <u>
-
-An emerging category in the past couple of years are Japanese and Chinese supermarket chains (the large scale Korean markets have not made their way here yet). Here are my favourites -
-
-[Don Don Donki (DDDK)](https://www.dondondonki.com/sg/)
-
-🎵‘When I'm free, I take myself to Don Don Donki’. Brainwashing tunes but all true - I love going to DDDK. The Japanese supermarket chain is a cult favourite in Singapore, with ~15 stores. Whilst at a slight premium, their products are fantastic, in particular their meat selections and rice bags. They also sell cooked foods i.e. bentos, takoyaki at an affordable price. Past 9pm, the cooked foods will be further discounted. I do feel their vegetable produce is overpriced so I’d avoid that section.
-
-| ![hotpot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hotpot.png)
-|:--:| 
-|  *I get all my hotpot meats from DDDK*  |
-
-[Mediya](https://www.meidi-ya.com.sg/en/)
-
-Similar to DDDK but without the crazy music. They have two sizable stores stocked with imported Japanese produce at a large scale. Personally, I’m a big fan of their soy products and their meat aisle..
-
-[Scarlett Supermarket](https://www.scarlettsupermarket.com.sg/)
-
-Chinese grocery chain that opened in 2020 and has expanded rapidly (~15 stores). Scarlett specializes in local Chinese snacks, confectionery and beverages, with a smaller selection of produce and frozen food items. By the way, [they sell 10L beers](https://mothership.sg/2022/02/scarlett-10l-beer-snacks/).
-
-[Yue Hwa](https://www.yuehwa.com.sg/en-us/)
-
-Sounds familiar? Yes, this is the same Yue Hwa as the one in Hong Kong. They stock up on a wide selection of Chinese dried food and medical products (China, HK, TW goods all inclusive) and their flagship store in Chinatown even sells home products. In particular, I stock up on egg rolls (榮華蛋捲) at Yue Hwa. Note - there is no fresh produce in store.
-
-<u> What about gourmet grocery stores? <u>
-
-Plenty of stores hit this category so I’m only highlighting a few that are well-known / that I frequent.
-
-[Little Farms](https://littlefarms.com/)
-
-Across 6 locations, Little Farms offer high quality, natural and organic produce. Personally, I rarely buy from them given their products are quite pricey. The one exception is their hummus / dips - their selection is divine.
-
-[Culina](https://www.culina.com.sg/)
-
-Dempsey’s a haven for good food and upscale lifestyle. Culina Marketplace is one of the fine spots there for all kinds of epicures. In fact, Culina is the meat provider for many Fairprice Finest stores. I ate at the Culina Bistro once and I thought it was very average, but the market overall has many gourmet aisles to browse through, including a bakery, fishmonger, butchery, fresh produce and dried goods.
-
-[Hubers](https://www.hubers.com.sg/)
-
-My go-to butcher if I were to throw a barbeque. It has the widest selection of fresh and frozen meats compared to all the grocery stores listed above, and you can purchase from a range of different price points. Hubers also has marinated options you can pick from. 
-
-<u> Is it worth going to wet markets? <u>
-
-Singapore wet markets are usually in the same complex as hawker centers but are at a MUCH smaller scale than that of Hong Kong’s. Whilst fruits / vegetable and fish stores are common, I find that there are fewer butcheries, especially butcheries specializing in beef. You also mostly see poultry/pork/beef that is already carved versus the carcass of the entire animal which is a common sight in Hong Kong wet markets. Overall, I find the shopping experience lackluster in Singapore. I would not recommend shopping in wet markets besides buying fruits and vegetables here and there.
-
-#### What grocery items are more expensive in Singapore vs Hong Kong?
-
-TL;DR - everything given import taxes. Specific items that are egregious include -
-
-+ Cured meats (ham, bacon, sausages are ~30% more expensive than HK)
-+ Alcohol (Singapore taxes vices)
-+ Ice cream (Ben and Jerry's + Haagan Dazs pints cost ~USD $11 a pint, 1.7X that of the US)
-+ Cheese (ridiculous versus Europe)
-+ Salad leaves
-
-##### My go-to grocery stores
-
-I cook almost every day so I frequent grocery stores a lot. Here is my grocery store strategy -
-
-+ For immediate needs: Fairprice near where I live
-+ For every day groceries: Fairprice Xtra Vivo City / Cold Storage Fresh Great World City
-+ For fresh fruit and vegetables (if time permits): Wet market near where I live
-+ For hotpot / Yakiniku: Don Don Don Ki near where I live
-+ For steaks / western meats: Hubers Butchery
-
-And that’s a wrap. Happy shopping! Don’t forget to subscribe to see more content like this.

-title:  "Guide to buying the Perfect Diamond Ring in Singapore... at 10% Off"
-categories: [Shopping, Diamonds, Proposal, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/diamond.png
----
-Congratulations! You’re ready to take the plunge and propose to the love of your life. But before you get down on one knee, there’s one important thing you need to do: buy an engagement ring.
-
-Purchasing a diamond ring is no easy feat, especially in Singapore. It's a high expense item in an industry with plenty of marketing BS. No worries though - with a little planning and research from this guide, you can find the perfect ring for your special someone.
-
-#### Your 5 steps in buying the right ring
-
-1. Set your budget
-2. Understand her requirements
-3. Research online
-4. Shop together in-store
-5. Buy alone, potentially abroad
-
-##### Step 1: Set your budget
-
-Setting a budget helps narrow down your options and avoid overspending.
-
-The budget for an engagement ring is a highly personal decision and can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances. Some people may choose to spend several months' salary on an engagement ring, while others may opt for a less expensive ring or even choose to forgo a ring altogether. You usually hear the benchmark of ‘spending 3 months of your salary’, which can be very low or very high depending on how much you earn.
-
-Ultimately, the most important factor is to choose a ring that reflects your love and commitment to your partner, and fits comfortably within your overall financial plan. It's important to prioritize your financial stability and avoid overspending on a ring, especially if it could lead to financial stress in the future. Communication with your partner about expectations and preferences can also help ensure that you both feel comfortable with the budget and the ring you ultimately choose.
-
-##### Step 2: Understand her diamond requirements
-
-Here’s a top tip every man should know - there’s an inverse relationship between surprising your lady with a ring and getting the ring that she wants. I’m in the camp of ‘getting it right’ given I’ll be spending a hefty sum. This means asking all the right questions beforehand, researching online for inspiration and going into the store for further exploration and fitting. The element of surprise that you should fall back on is the proposal itself versus what the ring looks like.
-
-| ![Surprise]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/surprise.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Surprise versus getting it right*  |
-
-As part of understanding what she wants, here’s my list of seven ultimate questions to make sure you’re hitting her requirements
-1. Does she want a diamond?
-2. Does she want a natural or lab diamond?
-3. Does the brand of the ring matter?
-4. Does she want to design her own ring?
-5. What are her 4C, shape and setting expectations? (more on that below)
-6. Can she tell the difference between the 4Cs, i.e. between a D and H in colour?
-7. What is her ring size?
-
-Let’s unpack some of these.
-
-<u> Diamond or something else <u>
-
-Diamonds are a classic and traditional choice for engagement rings, but other gemstones can offer unique and beautiful alternatives. Some popular gemstones for engagement rings include sapphires, emeralds, and rubies. These stones are known for their vibrant colors and can add a pop of color and personality to an engagement ring.
-
-<u> Natural vs lab diamond <u>
-
-TLDR - there’s not a huge difference between the two appearance wise. I’d recommend buying a lab diamond if your partner is ok with it given it's much cheaper.
-
-Lab-grown diamonds are created in a laboratory setting by replicating the conditions that result in the formation of natural diamonds. They are made up of the same material as natural diamonds, which is pure carbon arranged in a crystalline form. Natural diamonds, are formed over millions of years deep in the earth's mantle under intense heat and pressure. They are mined from the earth and can vary in quality and size depending on where they were formed. Both types of diamonds have the same physical and chemical properties and can be virtually identical to the naked eye. Lab-grown diamonds are MUCH cheaper than natural diamonds (up to 4X) less than natural diamonds of the same quality and size. Please don't buy a moissanite or some cubic zirconia. Your partner deserves better than that.
-
-<u> 4Cs <u>
-
-Carat weight - This refers to the weight of the diamond and is often the most well-known of the 4Cs. One carat is equal to 0.2 grams, and diamonds are typically sold in fractions of a carat. Carat usually ranges from 0.5 to 2.5, with inflection price points at 1, 1.2, 1.5, 2. For example, a 1 carat diamond is disproportionately pricier than a 0.95 carat diamond given its nice rounded number.
-
-Cut - The cut refers to how well a diamond has been cut and shaped to maximize its brilliance, fire, and overall beauty. A well-cut diamond will reflect light and sparkle more than a poorly cut diamond, even if the other 3Cs are the same. Cut grades range from excellent to very good to good, fair then poor. Ignore marketing BS that says your diamond has a heart and arrow pattern (example) - all excellent cut diamonds will naturally have this. 
-
-Color - This refers to how colorless or "white" a diamond is. The less color a diamond has, the more valuable it is. Diamonds are graded on a scale from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown). Aim for something in the range of D to H for a less yellowish diamond.
-
-Clarity - This refers to the presence or absence of blemishes or inclusions, which are internal or external flaws in the diamond. Diamonds with fewer inclusions and blemishes are considered more valuable. The acceptable range I see is between Fl and VS2.
-
-Whilst cut and carat may be more visible to the naked eye, clarity and colour is not. Check if your partner can tell the difference as a tier in colour or clarity can mean the difference in a few hundred or a thousand dollars. More on this later, but it shows the importance of knowing what factors can be traded off whilst working with your budget.

-
-<u> Setting and shape <u>
-
-When it comes to choosing a ring shape and setting, there are many options available. Here are some of the most popular ring shapes and settings:
-
-Ring shapes:
-1. Round - This is the most popular and classic diamond shape, known for its brilliant sparkle and versatility.
-2. Princess - This square-shaped diamond is also popular and has a modern look with sharp corners and brilliant sparkle.
-3. Cushion - This diamond shape has rounded corners and is known for its vintage-inspired look and romantic feel.
-4. Emerald - This rectangular diamond shape has long facets that create a "hall of mirrors" effect and a sophisticated, elegant look.
-5. Oval - This diamond shape is similar to round but has an elongated shape that can make fingers appear longer and more slender.
-

-|  *Source - Diamonds Factory*  |
-
-A ring setting is the part of a ring that holds the gemstone in place. It is typically made of metal (such as gold, platinum, or silver) and may feature prongs, bezels, or other types of clasps to secure the gemstone. The setting can play a big role in the overall look and feel of a ring. For example, a simple and classic prong setting can highlight the beauty of a center diamond, while a more intricate and ornate setting can add character and personality to a ring. Each luxury brand has their signature setting so be sure to check them out!
-
-#### Step 3: Research online
-
-To ease into the subject with your partner, I’d recommend first starting off with online research, whether that’s looking at jewelry sites or taking a peak at your friend’s engagement ring photos. Take the chance to feel out what she likes and make a mental note of it.
-
-#### Step 4: Shop together in-store
-
-Alongside the traditional jewelry powerhouses, more and more boutique / local brands have popped up. 
-
-<u> Local Singaporean brands <u>
-
-+ [Lee Hwa Jewelry](https://shop.leehwajewellery.com/): Around since 1970 and is one of the largest fine jewelry retailers in Singapore. They offer a wide range of jewelry pieces, from traditional to contemporary designs
-+ [SK Jewellery](https://www.skjewellery.com/): Affordable and trendy jewelry pieces that are perfect for everyday wear. They offer a range of designs, from minimalist to statement pieces.
-+ [Jann Paul](https://www.jannpaul.com/): JannPaul's signature product is the "Super Ideal Cut" diamond, which is cut to perfection using precise mathematical calculations to maximize the diamond's brilliance, fire, and scintillation
-+ [Love and Co](https://love-and-co.com/): One of Love & Co.'s signature product is the "LVC Promise Diamond," which is a diamond that has a special inscription on the girdle of the diamond. This inscription is only visible under a special magnifying glass and serves as a symbol of the couple's promise to each other
-+ [Carat 55](https://www.carat55.com/): Carat 55 offers a personalized service where customers can work with their team of expert designers to create unique and custom-made jewelry pieces.
-
-These brands have a mix of lab / natural diamonds at various price points, and are great value options. The quality of the diamond may vary but you’ll still be able to get top end stuff if you select the right rock.
-
-<u> International brands <u>
-
-These brands may cost up to 3-6X more than the local brands listed above. You’ll be paying a premium for the guarantee of a quality diamond, stellar craftsmanship and brand prestige.
-+ [Cartier](https://www.cartier.sg/)
-+ [Harry Winston](https://www.harrywinston.com/en/fine-jewelry/engagement-rings?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIv8mu6Iyt_gIVfZlmAh0WRAYAEAAYASAAEgKsbPD_BwE)
-+ [VCA](https://www.vancleefarpels.com/sg/en/home.html)
-+ [Tiffany](https://www.tiffany.sg/?omcid=ppc-sg_google_brand-core&utm_medium=cpc-sg&utm_source=google-paid&utm_campaign=ao-search&utm_content=brand+core+TiffanyT&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgMTT8Iyt_gIV2iQrCh0hqwuYEAAYASAAEgJ18vD_BwE)
-+ [Graff](https://www.graff.com/sg-en/home/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlumhBhClARIsABO6p-w5b0AmVNO2uXQV8Q4bGQozOQ09Fois3oMdctfhhq34nd0UrsFgngcaAmLYEALw_wcB)
-
-Each brand has its own rich history and heritage. Cartier has been around since 1847 and has a long history of creating iconic jewelry pieces for royalty and celebrities. Harry Winston is known for its high-quality diamonds and has been a favorite of celebrities for decades. VCA was founded in 1906 and is known for its unique and intricate jewelry designs. Tiffany has been around since 1837 and is known for its iconic blue box and classic designs. Graff is a relatively newer brand, founded in 1960, but has quickly gained a reputation for its exceptional diamonds and innovative designs. Note - DeBeers is no longer in Singapore but you can always order them online. Chopard does exist but selection is limited.
-
-Try these brands on! As much as similar designs exist amongst them, the emotional feeling for each ring differs.
-
-**How pricing works** 
-
-For local brands - [here’s](https://www.jannpaul.com/diamond-price-guide) a pricing guide from Jann paul that I really like. For a 1 carat diamond ring price, lab grown will be around $3500 SGD and natural will be around $10000 SGD.
-
-For international brands, pricing really varies. However, I can give you the directional economics behind pricing for one of these international boutiques
-+ **Change in carat**: +0.01CT → $200 SGD
-+ **Change in clarity**: +1 range in clarity (VS1 to VVS2) → $700 SGD
-+ **Change in colour**: +1 in colour (H to G) → $3K SGD
-+ **Change in metal**: Rose Gold / Yellow Gold to Platinum Gold → $600 SGD
-
-Again, these are factors you can trade off to best fit the ideal ring in your budget.
-
-<u> Resale value of diamond rings <u>
-
-I would not bank on it reselling for the same amount, unless you’re buying a high quality diamond from an international brand. Overall, the resale value of a diamond can range anywhere from 20% to 60% of its retail value, depending on the factors mentioned above. It's always a good idea to get an appraisal from a reputable diamond dealer or jeweler to get an accurate estimate of the resale value of your diamond.
-
-#### Step 5: Buy alone
-
-First off, I recommend buying the diamond alone to maintain the surprise factor and to keep the price of the ring under wraps. Second, I recommend buying the diamond outside of Singapore if you are buying from one of the international brands. Prices are generally the same internationally, but tax refunds will allow you to save up to 12% (country dependent) of total price. Say you are looking to buy a SGD $30,000 ring. Instead of buying it in Singapore, buying it in Paris will cost you $26,400 instead. That’s $3,600 in savings. You can totally fly to Paris for the weekend, pick up the ring and fly back to Singapore and you’ll still be spending less than buying in town! Even if you declare and pay 7% GST when you bring the ring back to Singapore, you are getting a 5% discount. Always buy abroad if you have the option. It'll make your expensive ring feel like an affordable ring.
-
----
-
-In conclusion, buying a diamond ring can be a significant decision that requires careful consideration. It is essential to understand the different aspects of diamond quality. Whether purchasing an engagement ring or a piece of jewelry for a special occasion, it is crucial to work with a reputable jeweler who can provide guidance and advice on selecting the perfect diamond ring. With proper research and a clear understanding of your needs and budget, buying a diamond ring can be a memorable and meaningful experience that will bring joy and happiness for years to come. I know I loved my ring shopping journey.
-

-title:  "Guide to the best Singapore neighbourhoods to live in"
-categories: [Neighbourhoods, Living, Housing, Singapore]

----
-Singapore is a bustling city-state with a diverse range of neighborhoods, each with its own unique features and attractions. Whether you're a family with children, a young professional, or a retiree, there's a neighborhood in Singapore that's perfect for you. In this guide, we'll take a look at the best neighborhoods to live in Singapore, what makes them stand out, and why they're great places to call home. We’ll take an expat lens to this article given we’re assuming locals are already living in their existing family homes.
-

-|  *Singapore skyline at night*  |
-
-#### Factors to consider when selecting a neighbourhood
-
-Reminder - this is largely dependent on your individual needs, preferences, and lifestyle
-1. Proximity to work or school: Saves time and money on transportation
-2. Cost of living: The closer to the city center, the more expensive it’ll be. Determine your budget and look for neighborhoods that fit within your financial means
-3. Amenities and facilities: Consider the amenities and facilities that are important to you, such as [grocery stores](https://fromhktosg.github.io/grocery/), hawker centers, shopping malls, tennis courts and parks. Look for neighborhoods that offer easy access to the amenities and facilities that you need
-4. Transportation options: Closer to the MRT, more expensive it is. However, it makes commuting around the city more convenient and efficient
-5. Lifestyle and culture: Consider the vibe and atmosphere of the neighborhood to determine whether it is a good fit for your lifestyle and interests
-
-#### How does Singapore classify their neighbourhoods?
-
-There are a total of 28 districts in Singapore, numbered from 1 to 28. Directionally, districts 1 to 10 are in more central areas, whilst the higher numbers are more near the outskirts.
-

-
-#### Popular neighbourhoods to live in
-
-On to the main course -
-
-<u> District 01 / 2 - Raffles Place, Marina, Tanjong Pagar <u>
-
-| ![tjp]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tjp.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Source - Discover Tanjong Pagar*  |
-
-The Raffles Place Tanjong Pagar area is a bustling neighborhood in the heart of Singapore's Central Business District (CBD). It’s in close proximity to Marina Bay Sands, several museums and galleries and the Merlion.
-
-Pros:
-+ Prime location to CBD and sightseeing spots
-+ Excellent transportation with the green and red train lines intercrossing. Plenty of buses to this area too
-+ High-end living close to luxurious shopping centers, five-star hotels and fine-dining restaurants
-+ Vibrant nightlife - plenty of bars and clubs
-
-Cons:
-+ Not child friendly
-+ Limited space (reflected by a smaller number of condos there)
-+ Hustle and bustle on weekdays, dead on weekends
-+ Can be quite a touristy area
-+ Expensive (though not as pricey as Orchard)
-+ Lack of greenery - it’s primarily a concrete jungle
-
-<u> District 15 - Joo Chiat, Marina Parade, Katong <u>
-
-| ![ecp]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ecp.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Source - Time Out*  |
-
-Aka East Coast. The East Coast of Singapore refers to the eastern coastal region of the island nation. The area I’m most referring to is the Marina parade area near the beginning of East Coast park versus anything more in land i.e Geylang / Paya Lebar, or out further east i.e. Siglap.
-
-Pros: 
-+ Beautiful beaches and parks
-+ Vast open spaces with larger size condos and bungalows. This is the primary reason for many
-+ Rich cultural heritage - cute architectural neighbourhoods nearby
-
-Cons:
-+ High cost of living. The area ain’t cheap but PSF will still be slightly better than CBD / Orchard
-+ A little further from the city center, though a MRT line will be built in this region
-
-<u> District 03 - Tiong Bahru, Alexandra, Queenstown <u>
-
-| ![tb]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tb.jpg)

-|  *Source - Qantas*  |
-
-Tiong Bahru is a residential neighborhood in the central region of Singapore, located just a few kilometers from the city center. It is known for its unique architecture, art deco buildings, and vibrant street life. The neighborhood has a rich history, dating back to the 1920s, and was one of the first housing estates in Singapore. It was built to provide affordable housing for the working-class, and many of the original low-rise buildings still stand today. Tiong Bahru is a mix of old and new, with charming pre-war shophouses and modern high-rise apartments. It has become a trendy and hipster destination in recent years, with plenty of independent boutiques, cafes, and art galleries popping up. The Alexandra and Queenstown area are both fantastic living spots too, with a more residential vibe and cheaper rental prices.
-

-
-This area is known for its high-end shopping malls, luxury apartments, and proximity to the Central Business District. It is a popular area for expats who want to live in the heart of the city and enjoy a luxurious lifestyle. River Valley is also a part of this district. With open spaces, convenience to CBD and international schools, River Valley is a popular expat living area.

-
-Personally, I value open space, greenery, a more quiet lifestyle and proximity to the city. Hence, the districts above are **ranked based on my preference of least preferred to best preferred**. That being said, all of these districts are fantastic locations to live in.
-
-#### What about the Heartlands?
-
-The "heartlands" in Singapore generally refer to the residential estates located outside the city center. These are neighborhoods where many Singaporeans live, work, and go about their daily lives. The heartlands are known for their HDB flats (public housing apartments) and amenities such as hawker centers, community centers, parks, and shopping malls. Some of the more well-known heartland areas in Singapore include Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bukit Batok, Jurong East, Tampines, Toa Payoh, Woodlands and Yishun.
-
-Pros:
-+ Lower cost of living: Housing in the heartlands, especially HDB flats, is generally more affordable than in the city center. This can translate to lower living expenses and more savings
-+ Strong sense of community: The heartlands are known for their close-knit communities and friendly neighbors. Living in the heartlands can provide a sense of belonging and community spirit, which can be particularly beneficial for families with children or seniors
-+ Access to amenities and facilities: The heartlands have many amenities and facilities such as hawker centers, community centers, parks, and shopping malls. These offer convenient access to everyday necessities, as well as opportunities for leisure and recreation
-+ Good transportation connections: While the heartlands are further away from the city center, they are well-connected to public transportation, including MRT trains and buses. This makes commuting to work or school relatively easy and convenient
-+ Diverse cultural experiences: Singapore's heartlands are home to a diverse mix of cultures and communities, each with their own unique character and traditions. Living in the heartlands can offer opportunities to experience and appreciate this cultural richness
-
-Cons:
-+ Distance from the city center: The heartlands are located further away from the city center, so if you work or study in the central business district (CBD), you may have to factor in longer commuting times and transportation costs
-+ Lack of nightlife: While the heartlands have their own amenities, they may not offer as many options for entertainment and nightlife compared to the city center. If you enjoy going out and socializing, living in the heartlands may not be the best option for you
-+ HDB heavy. Personally not a problem for me but I know folks who care
-
-Overall, the heartlands of Singapore can offer a comfortable and affordable way of life, with access to all the amenities and facilities needed for daily living. It can be an ideal option for those who prioritize community, convenience, and value for money.
-

-
-#### What to watch out for when buying furniture
-
-+ Quality - Make sure that the furniture you are purchasing is made of high-quality materials and is built to last. Look for solid wood construction (especially for wardrobes), sturdy joints, and high-quality finishes.
-+ Comfort - Test out chairs, sofas, sofa beds, and mattresses to make sure that they are comfortable and provide adequate support.
-+ Size and Scale - When buying furniture, it's important to consider the size and scale of the piece in relation to the room it will be placed in. A large, bulky sofa may look great in a showroom, but it may overwhelm a small living room. Make sure that the furniture you are purchasing fits the space and complements the other pieces in the room.
-+ Functionality - Consider how the furniture will be used and whether it is functional for your needs. For example, if you have children or pets, you may want to opt for furniture that is easy to clean and durable. If you work from home, you may need a desk or office chair that provides adequate support for long periods of sitting.
-+ Price - Price is always a consideration when making a purchase, but it's important to balance price with quality. While you may be tempted to opt for cheaper furniture, it may end up costing you more in the long run if it needs to be replaced frequently. Consider investing in higher-quality pieces that will last for years to come.
-+ Delivery and Assembly - Finally, consider the logistics of getting the furniture to your home. Make sure that the store offers delivery and assembly services and factor these costs into your budget
-+ Vibe - Make sure your furniture pieces complement each other. Getting an ID can always help with this
-
-#### My favourite places to buy furniture
-
-My furniture combination arises from these stores. Most if not all of these do delivery and assembly so no need to fret if you cannot wield a screwdriver.
-
-+ Castlery - simple and modern 
-+ Crate and barrel - quality furniture at mid to aspirational price points (now closed in Apr 2023)
-+ Harvey Norman - surprising discovery given its usually associated with electronic products. Harvey Norman does provide a solid selection of furniture and often throws in bulk purchasing discounts
-+ Ikea - good ol’ Ikea. The mecca of furniture stores. No one can deny their affordability and tasty swedish meatballs

-title:  "2023 education review: Hong Kong vs. Singapore - who is on top?"
-categories: [Education, Academics, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/school.jpg
----
-I have vivid memories of my post-school hours in Hong Kong, where I would slug myself from schools to various tuition centers, immersing myself in a whirlwind of enrichment education. Why? I felt pressured to get ahead of the school curve and be top of the assessment syllabi. It wasn’t my parents who gave me this pressure. It was pressure put on myself.
-
-Education in both Hong Kong and Singapore is seen as a key to success and upward mobility given the emphasis on hard work and achievement. As such, their education systems have been developed to ensure that their citizens are equipped with the necessary skills to compete in the global market. However, while both countries' education systems have similarities, there are also significant differences in terms of their structure, curriculum, and teaching methods. Today, we’ll unpack the education in Singapore. We’ll save the discussions on enrichment education for another time.
-
-#### Hong Kong’s local education system
-Hong Kong's local education system is a product of the British colonial legacy. It consists of six years of primary education, three years of junior secondary education, and three years of senior secondary education. At the end of senior secondary education, students take the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) examination, which determines their eligibility for university admission. The HKDSE is considered one of the most competitive high school exams in the world, with students required to achieve high grades in multiple subjects to secure a place in a prestigious university.
-
-#### Singapore’s local education system
-Singapore's education system follows a more centralized and standardized approach. It consists of six years of primary education, four years of secondary education, and two to three years of post-secondary education (aka Junior college or JC). Students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) at the end of primary school, which determines their eligibility for secondary school. At the end of secondary school, students take the General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (GCE O-level) examination, which determines their eligibility for post-secondary education. Students who wish to pursue higher education must take the GCE Advanced Level (GCE A-level) examination, which is similar to the HKDSE.
-
-#### The similarities
-The main similarity between Hong Kong and Singapore's education systems is the emphasis on rote learning, memorization and academic performance. The contrast for international schools or a US education system is the emphasis on creativity, problem solving and critical thinking. Both schools of systems have their own pros and cons, although a western one seems more practical in today’s day and age.
-
-#### The differences
-One of the differences is the language of instruction. In Hong Kong, Cantonese is the primary language of instruction, with English taught as a second language. However, with the increasing influence of mainland China, there has been a growing emphasis on Mandarin. In contrast, Singapore's education system is bilingual, with English and Mandarin taught as the two official languages.
-
-In terms of resources, both Hong Kong and Singapore have well-funded education systems. However, Singapore has invested heavily in educational technology, with many schools incorporating digital learning tools and platforms into their curriculum. Hong Kong, on the other hand, has faced criticism for its lack of investment in educational technology, with many schools still relying on traditional teaching methods. Montessori schools are also very popular in Singapore if that education system suits your child.
-
-#### Top junior colleges in Singapore that you need to know
-
-These schools are akin to the top secondary schools in Hong Kong, i.e. Diocesan Boys' School (DBS), Diocesan Girls' School (DGS) St. Paul's Co-educational College (SPCC), La Salle College (LSC).
-
-1. Singapore's Junior College (JC) system provides two years of pre-university education to students who have completed their GCE O-Level examinations. Here are some of the top Junior Colleges in Singapore:
-2. Raffles Institution (RI) - RI is the oldest and one of the most prestigious JCs in Singapore. It has a strong academic reputation and a rigorous curriculum that prepares students for university education.
-3. Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) - HCI is known for its academic excellence and its emphasis on character development. It offers a range of programs that cater to students with different interests and strengths.
-4. National Junior College (NJC) - NJC is one of the top JCs in Singapore, known for its strong academic program and its commitment to holistic education. It offers a range of co-curricular activities and programs that help students develop leadership skills and social responsibility.
-5. Victoria Junior College (VJC) - VJC is known for its strong academic program and its commitment to developing well-rounded students. It offers a range of co-curricular activities and programs that help students develop their leadership and interpersonal skills.
-6. Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) - ACJC is known for its strong academic program and its emphasis on character development. It offers a range of co-curricular activities and programs that cater to students with different interests and strengths.
-7. Nanyang Junior College (NYJC) - NYJC is known for its strong academic program and its emphasis on character development. It offers a range of co-curricular activities and programs that cater to students with different interests and strengths
-
-#### What about international schools?
-
-There are several reasons why someone might choose to attend an international school in Singapore over a local school:
-+ Curriculum: International schools often offer a broader and more diverse curriculum than local schools. They may also follow international standards, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, which can provide students with a globally recognized education. Less focused on hard facts
-+ Language: Many international schools in Singapore offer bilingual programs or instruction in languages other than English, which can be a valuable skill in an increasingly globalized world.
-+ Cultural Diversity: International schools attract students from all over the world, which creates a diverse student body that can expose students to different cultures and perspectives.
-+ Exposure to international universities: Attending an international school can also provide students with more opportunities to explore and apply to universities abroad, as many international schools have connections to universities around the world.
-+ Networking: The international environment of an international school can provide students with valuable networking opportunities, both during their time at school and after graduation.
-
-That being said, there are also advantages to attending a local school in Singapore, such as a stronger focus on Singaporean culture and the local education system, as well as potentially lower costs. Ultimately, the decision to attend an international school or a local school depends on the individual's goals and priorities.
-
-Getting into an international school in Singapore 
-+ It can be competitive, especially if there is a long waitlist. Some tips
-+ Start early: It's best to begin the application process as early as possible, ideally a year in advance. This will give you more time to prepare, and you'll be able to apply before the school reaches its capacity.
-+ Know your advantage - i.e. holding an American passport or working for an American company can give you priority in the waitlist
-+ Donating - donating money doesn’t guarantee a spot in an international school, but provides a competitive advantage
-+ Attend open houses: Attend open houses or information sessions offered by the school to get a better understanding of the school's culture and academic program. This can also give you a chance to meet with school representatives and ask questions.
-+ Stay in touch: Keep in touch with the school and check in periodically to see if there have been any updates regarding your application status. This shows your continued interest in the school and may help you stand out from other applicants.
-
-#### Top international schools and their fees in singapore
-
-These schools are akin to Hong Kong international school (HKIS) and any of the ESF schools.
-
-+ United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA) - UWCSEA is a leading international school in Singapore that offers a challenging and holistic education to students from over 70 countries. The school fees for the academic year 2023-2024 range from SGD 41,124 to SGD 48,420 per year for Kindergarten to Grade 12.
-+ Singapore American School (SAS) - SAS is one of the largest international schools in Singapore, with over 4,000 students from over 50 countries. The school fees for the academic year 2023-2024 range from SGD 43,574 to SGD 49,448 per year for Kindergarten to Grade 12.
-+ Canadian International School (CIS) - CIS is a leading international school in Singapore that offers a Canadian curriculum and the IB program. The school fees for the academic year 2023-2024 range from SGD 31,480 to SGD 42,620 per year for Kindergarten to Grade 12.
-+ Stamford American International School (SAIS) - SAIS is a top international school in Singapore that offers the IB program and a range of academic and co-curricular programs. The school fees for the academic year 2023-2024 range from SGD 33,622 to SGD 46,438 per year for Kindergarten to Grade 12.
-+ Australian International School (AIS) - AIS is a leading international school in Singapore that offers an Australian curriculum and the IB program. The school fees for the academic year 2023-2024 range from SGD 34,458 to SGD 41,134 per year for Kindergarten to Grade 12.
-+ Dulwich College International is a network of international schools with campuses in Asia, including Singapore. Dulwich College (Singapore) offers a British-style education to students from age 2 to 18 years old. The school fees for the academic year 2023-2024 at Dulwich College (Singapore) are as follows:
-    + Nursery (Age 2): SGD 27,658 per year
-    + Early Years (Age 3-4): SGD 36,201 per year
-    + Primary School (Age 5-10): SGD 39,160 to SGD 43,406 per year
-    + Junior School (Age 11-13): SGD 43,649 per year
-    + Senior School (Age 14-18): SGD 46,481 to SGD 49,207 per year
-
-As you can see, international school prices can be ridiculously high, and almost as expensive as College in the US. Is it worth it? That’s a personal decision for each household. Speaking from someone who attended international school, the benefits I see are:
-+ Less pressure than my peers in international school
-+ Mastery of spoken English
-+ Exposure to more academic subjects, versus being siloed into arts, sciences, literature
-+ Availability of extracurricular activities (covered by the school)
-+ Network of friends who are of higher socio-economic status (I don’t select friends based on how much money they have but values are at least somewhat similar)
-
-Of course, school fees were more affordable back in the days and not everyone has the luxury to afford international school. However, I think I benefited immensely from the international school system and I would strive to provide the same for my own children.

-title:  "Why Singapore's nature and outdoors falls slightly short"
-categories: [Hong Kong, Nature, Outdoors, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/macritchie.jpg
----
-Given the similarities between Hong Kong and Singapore, I’ve always wondered why Singapore lacked ‘naturey’ things to do. After all, I remember spending summers in Hong Kong out in the wild, be it hiking a new trail, visiting beaches, exploring rock pools or going on junk trips. The reality is that whilst both countries plan meticulously to preserve their natural environment, Singapore has a flatter and smaller landmass as well as a much more artificial approach in tackling the same situation. Today, we’ll dive into both countries' approaches to nature planning and conservation, why Hong Kong’s natural landscape trump that of Singapore’s and what natural attractions and activities you can still do in Singapore.
-
-#### Hong Kong’s approach
-
-Hong Kong has designated several areas as Country Parks, covering around 40% of the total land area. According to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, there are 24 Country Parks, 22 Special Areas, and 12 Marine Parks in Hong Kong as of March 2021. These parks provide opportunities for hiking, camping, and other recreational activities, while also safeguarding the region's unique flora and fauna.
-
-In addition, the Hong Kong government has established a number of protected marine parks, covering around 6% of the territorial waters. These parks are important for the conservation of marine biodiversity, which is under threat from pollution and overfishing. According to the Hong Kong Marine Conservation Society, there are more than 5,000 marine species in Hong Kong waters, including endangered species such as the Chinese White Dolphin and the Green Sea Turtle.
-
-#### Singapore’s approach
-
-Singapore has implemented a comprehensive green infrastructure strategy, which includes the creation of parks, nature reserves, and other green spaces throughout the city. According to the National Parks Board, Singapore has around 350 parks and 4 nature reserves covering around 12% of the total land area. The parks and nature reserves provide opportunities for recreation, exercise, and relaxation, as well as preserving the city's biodiversity. Singapore has also embarked on a project to transform its waterways into natural ecosystems, with the aim of improving water quality and biodiversity. The Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) program aims to transform the city's waterways into natural environments that can support a variety of plants and animals. 
-
-#### Urban planning for both
-
-In terms of urban planning, both Hong Kong and Singapore have incorporated green spaces into their development plans. Singapore has been particularly successful in this regard, with green roofs, vertical gardens, and other features becoming increasingly common in new buildings. There are over 1 million square meters of green roofs in Singapore as of 2020. In addition, the city has implemented a policy of requiring developers to provide a certain amount of green space in their projects.
-
-Hong Kong has also incorporated green spaces into its urban planning, but the density of the city makes it more challenging to create large parks and other natural areas. Nevertheless, the city has implemented measures to increase greenery in the urban environment, such as the "Greening, Landscape and Tree Management Section" under the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, which manages over 7,500 hectares of parks and gardens, and plants around 1 million trees and shrubs each year, according to the department's website.
-
-#### Why Hong Kong’s natural attractions are more prevalent and exciting than Singapore
-
-While Hong Kong has more designated nature areas, such as Country Parks and Marine Parks, compared to Singapore, there are several reasons why this is the case.
-
-1. Hong Kong has a larger land area compared to Singapore. Hong Kong covers an area of approximately 1,106 square kilometers, while Singapore covers an area of only 728.3 square kilometers. This means that Hong Kong has more land available for nature conservation and recreation. The bigger the better
-
-2. Hong Kong has a higher proportion of natural land cover compared to Singapore. According to a study by the University of Hong Kong, around 70% of Hong Kong's land area is classified as natural land cover, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. In contrast, only around 20% of Singapore's land area is classified as natural land cover, with most of the remaining land used for urban development
-
-3. Hong Kong has a more rugged terrain compared to Singapore, which has made it more difficult to develop and urbanize. This has resulted in large areas of undeveloped land that have been designated as nature reserves or parks. In contrast, Singapore has had to reclaim land from the sea to accommodate its growing population, which has reduced the amount of natural land available. This lack of natural landforms limits the development of natural habitats, which in turn affects the diversity of species that can be supported. It also poses challenges for the creation of hiking trails and outdoor recreational activities.
-
-4. Singapore’s lack of b​iodiversity: Singapore's rapid development has led to the loss of many natural habitats, such as forests, mangroves, and wetlands. This has caused a decline in native species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. In addition, the introduction of non-native species has also impacted the biodiversity of the region. For example, the Red-whiskered Bulbul, an invasive bird species, competes with native bird species for resources and has been known to drive them out of their habitats.
-
-Due to Singapore's small size and high population density, there are limited opportunities to create large, connected natural areas. This fragmentation of habitats makes it difficult for wildlife to move and interact, which can lead to reduced genetic diversity and the loss of ecosystem services. To address this, Singapore has established a network of nature reserves and green corridors to link up fragmented habitats and promote biodiversity conservation.
-
-With what’s available, here’s my take on the best nature things to do in Singapore

-
-#### Best nature spots and hikes in Singapore
-
-Singapore's a [small island](https://fromhktosg.github.io/top-concerns/) but here are the things to do.
-
-Parks
-+ Gardens by the Bay - a stunning 250-acre nature park that features large supertrees, flower domes, and a Cloud Forest. Man-made
-+ Singapore Botanic Gardens - a UNESCO World Heritage Site that spans 74 hectares and features a wide variety of tropical plants and flowers. Great when not hot
-+ Fort Canning Park - a historic park that features lush greenery, heritage trails, and an amphitheater. In the heart of the city. Filled with mosquitoes though
-
-Hikes
-+ MacRitchie Reservoir - a nature reserve that offers several hiking trails and scenic views of the reservoir. Pretty much the only ‘long’ hike in Singapore
-+ Bukit Timah Nature Reserve - a 164-hectare rainforest reserve that is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna.
-+ Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve - a mangrove swamp that is home to many bird species and offers an opportunity to see a variety of wildlife up close. Plenty of crocodiles here
-Labrador Nature Reserve - a coastal park that offers hiking trails, a mangrove boardwalk, and great views of the sea.
-+ Southern Ridges - a 10-kilometer trail that connects several parks and nature reserves, offering stunning views of the city and the Southern Islands.
-
-Beaches
-+ Sentosa - man-made but a nice visit once in a while. Junk trips off the island here
-+ Changi beach - out far east but a surprisingly relaxing spot. Kayak, fish and windsurf
-+ East coast - too packed. Nothing special but great for an evening walk
-
-#### How Singapore is strengthening up its existing nature status quo
-
-| ![mandai]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mandai.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Newly opened Bird Paradise*  |
-
-It’s not all doom and gloom. Singapore is trying to increase nature activities and improve nature integration in its development plan.
-
-1. Mandai Rejuvenation Project: The Mandai Rejuvenation Project is a long-term initiative that aims to transform the Mandai area into a nature destination. The project will include the relocation and redevelopment of the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari, and Bird Park to create a more integrated wildlife experience. The project also includes the creation of a nature-themed resort, a rainforest park, and a nature-themed indoor attraction.
-2. City in Nature plan by 2030
-    + Greening and Blueing: This strategy aims to expand green spaces and water bodies across the city to enhance biodiversity and provide residents with access to nature. The government plans to add 200 hectares of green spaces and 50 hectares of water bodies by 2030.
-    + Enhancing biodiversity: Singapore aims to enhance its biodiversity by restoring and creating habitats for wildlife. The government plans to restore 1000 hectares of forest and mangroves and create a network of nature parks and corridors.
-    + Sustainable resource management: This strategy focuses on sustainable resource management by promoting the efficient use of resources, reducing waste, and increasing recycling. The government plans to reduce waste sent to landfill by 30% by 2030.
-    + Climate action: Singapore aims to mitigate the impacts of climate change and build resilience against its effects. The government plans to reduce its carbon emissions intensity by 36% by 2030 and promote renewable energy.
-    + Engaging the community: The government plans to engage the community in its efforts to create a City in Nature by promoting environmental awareness, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the environment, and encouraging active participation in conservation efforts.

-Overall, Singapore is committed to preserving and enhancing its natural environment. The government has taken measures to expand green spaces and water bodies, restore and create habitats for wildlife, promote sustainable resource management, take action on climate change, and engage the community in conservation efforts. However, it is difficult to compare Singapore's efforts with those of Hong Kong as both cities have unique geographical, cultural, and historical factors that influence their approach to conservation and sustainability. Unlucky.

-title:  "Expert guide for holiday destinations out of Singapore in 2023"
-categories: [Flights, Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/plane1.jpg
----
-There was a long weekend this past month in Singapore, and naturally, many Singaporeans traveled abroad.
-
-Personally, I love traveling. I once insisted that the number of unique countries I've visited equated to my age. While I am fortunate enough to be achieving that, I find myself wanting to revisit specific countries that I have enjoyed before. Today, we’ll dive into traveling out of Singapore, popular tourist destinations and how to optimize your flight loyalty programs.
-
-#### Why do Singaporeans love to travel?
-
-I have always wondered, but it was not until I experienced the city for myself that I realized the reasons below.
-
-+ There’s not much to do in Singapore - what’s new
-+ Close proximity to cheap South East Asian countries. Spend less than $500 SGD on flights and hotels for a 5 day trip? Worth
-+ Seek activities that are not easily accessible in Singapore, such as skiing, hiking, or surfing
-+ Escape the heat (i.e. to AU, JP, KR)
-+ Did I mention [there’s not much to do in Singapore](https://fromhktosg.github.io/top-concerns/)?
-
-Travel is often seen as an escape for Singaporeans because it offers a chance to disconnect from the fast-paced, high-pressure environment of the city-state and experience different cultures, scenery, and lifestyles. For many, travel is also a way to recharge and gain new perspectives, which can help alleviate stress and burnout. Personally, I try to squeeze in 3-4 short trips within Asia and one longer trip to the US or Europe each year.
-
-While travel can provide a temporary respite from the stresses of daily life, it's important to acknowledge that it is not a sustainable or permanent solution to these issues. Ultimately, learning to appreciate life in Singapore is the ultimate goal, but it takes time and reaching certain stages in life to truly grasp its value.
-
-#### Popular short - mid range holiday destinations from Singapore
-
-Enough philosophy. Here are some popular destinations to travel to from Singapore
-
-+ Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - (1 hour from SG) Malaysia truly Asia
-+ Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam - (2 hours from SG) Unique blend of natural beauty, rich history, and delicious cuisine. Dirt cheap
-+ Bangkok, Thailand - (2.5 hours from SG) Famed for its street food, night markets, and temples, Bangkok offers a mix of tradition and modernity that appeals to many Singaporean travelers
-+ Bali, Indonesia (2.5 hours from SG) - Known for its beautiful beaches, cultural landmarks, and vibrant nightlife, Bali is a popular destination for Singaporeans seeking a quick getaway
-+ Hong Kong - (4 hours from SG) Bustling shopping districts to its theme parks and historic landmarks
-+ Seoul, South Korea - (6 hours from SG) A city that never sleeps. Fan favourite for those that love shopping, food, and entertainment
-+ Taipei, Taiwan - (6 hours from SG) From its night markets to its hot springs, Taipei offers a unique blend of modern amenities and traditional culture that attracts many Singaporean travelers
-+ Tokyo, Japan - (7.5 hours from SG) A city that blends the ancient and the contemporary, Tokyo is a popular destination for Singaporeans looking to experience Japanese culture and cuisine. Yen is so fucking cheap please go
-
-For 2023, my top travel destinations are Japan (depreciating yen), Seoul (shopping shopping shopping) and New Zealand (hikes, nature and the cold)
-
-#### Changi vs HKIA
-
-Similar to Hong Kong, Singapore only has one airport to fly out of for the average joe. Changi airport (Singapore) and Hong Kong International Airport are both renowned for best-in-class facilities, speed and comfort. Whilst the pandemic has had a scintillating impact on both, Hong Kong’s airport was disproportionately hollowed given the city’s strict quarantine rules. Comparing the stats between the two -
-
-|     | Changi | HKIA  |
-| :---        |    :----:   | :---: |
-| Passenger traffic (2021)      |  25.5M    |   9.9M    |
-| Connectivity  | 100 airlines serving 220 destinations    | 120 airlines serving 220 destinations     |
-| Runways / terminals   | 4 terminals 2 runways| 2 terminals 2 runways |
-
-With incredible comfort at both airports, arriving 1.5 hours before your flight provides plenty of buffer time. Often, I’d arrive earlier too for lounge access or just to walk around the shops. For Singapore residents (PR, epass, citizens), you’d go through automatic gates during customs as well which saves a lot of time.
- 
-<u> Airline companies <u>
-
-The two major airlines of these countries need no introduction. Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are both major airlines based in Asia, and both are known for their high-quality service and premium offerings. 
-
-Here are some comparisons between the two (note - some of this might be legacy given COVID reopenings):
-
-|     | Cathay Pacific | Singapore Airlines  |
-| :---        |    :----:   | :---: |
-| Network and destinations     |  80 destinations   |   130 destinations    |
-| Fleet  | 150 aircrafts    | 130 aircrafts    |
-| Economy class experience   | Top notch | Top notch |
-| Business class experience   | Top notch | Top notch |
-| Lounge experience   | Top notch | Top notch |
-| Inflight food   | Better than SQ | Still really good |
-| Loyalty program   | Easier to earn on Asia Miles than Krisflyer | Krisflyer |
-
-Personally, I’m still a Cathay Pacific fan boy, but have since made the switch to optimizing for SQ miles instead (more on that in the next section). One thing important to note is Krisflyer does have its budget airline arm which is Scoot Airlines. Taking a short trip to Bali / Bangkok? This is the go-to.
-
-#### My strategy for airline optimization
-
-Whilst this article does not focus on mileage accrual tactics, I do want to cover my strategy for airline optimization.
-
-Before 2020:
-+ Cathay Gold (One World)
-+ SQ Silver (Star Alliance)
-
-Personally, I was a loyal customer of Cathay Pacific before the pandemic and maintained a Gold status. However, it ultimately does have its inconvenience when flying. For example, if I were to go to Seoul, the best One World / Cathay Pacific flight path is to fly from Singapore to Hong Kong, then Hong Kong to Seoul. On the other hand, a SQ flight or even an Asiana flight (part of Star Alliance) could get me to Seoul directly, saving an extra 4-5 hours. Cathay Pacific simply does not have a hub in Singapore. As a result, it may not be the most convenient option for travelers looking to fly to or from Singapore, especially if they are looking for non-stop flights.
-
-Now aiming for:
-+ SQ Gold, PPS club
-+ Cathay Silver
-
-For Hong Kong-ers, unless you’re constantly flying back to Hong Kong or your company allows you to layover in Hong Kong before jetting off elsewhere for your work trips (that was my case), I would recommend switching over to Star Alliance for more direct trips. All that being said, I’d like to maintain silver for Cathay simply for checking in at the business class counter.
-
-#### Random tidbits when re-entering Changi airport
-
-+ Automatic gates to re-enter. Don’t queue for the immigration counter.
-+ Remember to fill in your health arrival form
-+ Don’t do drugs and traffic drugs
-    + It’s bad for you
-    + Capital punishment if you’re caught with any
-    + Risk of getting tested of drugs in your system
-+ Don’t hand carry a bunch of branded shopping bags when passing customs in Singapore. If you get GST taxed on those items, it’s your fault. It’s a matter of luck though. I’ve seen a girl hauling a Birkin and carrying 3 LV shopping bags and got away with it. Bring a duffle bag instead to hold your luxury goods if you want to hand carry.
-+ For those who like a tipple - buy your duty free drinks. The alcohol limit for duty-free allowance in Singapore is 1 liter of spirits, 1 liter of wine, and 1 liter of beer per person. These limits apply to both arriving and departing passengers, and the alcohol must be in unopened and original packaging
-

-title:  "Guide to the best shopping malls in Singapore"
-categories: [Shopping, Hong Kong, Malls, Loyalty program, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/ion.jpg
----
-Shopping malls have become an integral part of Singapore's urban landscape, with their ubiquitous presence contributing significantly to the city's social, economic, and cultural fabric. These vast complexes have become more than mere retail destinations, but rather serve as multifaceted hubs of activity where Singaporeans can meet, shop, dine, and socialize. In this post we will delve into the critical role that shopping malls play, the popular malls in town and overall shopping strategy in Singapore. 
-
-#### Why are shopping malls everywhere in Singapore
-
-Every MRT stop has a shopping mall. Almost every. Why is that the case?
-
-One of the reasons why many MRT stations in Singapore have shopping malls is because of the government's urban planning strategy. The government has been actively promoting the concept of "integrated developments" where residential, commercial, and transportation facilities are located in close proximity to each other. This strategy aims to promote convenience and accessibility for residents and visitors to Singapore.
-
-In the case of MRT stations, the idea is to create a seamless and convenient shopping experience for commuters. By having shopping malls located directly adjacent to MRT stations, commuters can easily access these malls without having to walk long distances or take additional transportation. This also provides an opportunity for businesses to benefit from the high traffic flow of commuters passing through the MRT stations. 
-
-Additionally, the government also aims to encourage the development of commercial spaces within the city to increase employment opportunities and boost the economy. Having shopping malls connected to MRT stations can attract more visitors, further increasing the commercial value of these spaces. This is not rocket science given a similar model exists in JP and HK.
-
-#### The role of shopping malls in Singapore
-
-Shopping malls have emerged as essential spaces for social interaction, providing a comfortable and safe environment for people to connect with friends and family. Malls offer a myriad of entertainment options, including cinemas, game arcades, and food courts, making them an ideal location for people to spend their leisure time. The presence of social amenities such as restrooms, nursing rooms, and free Wi-Fi makes shopping malls an attractive location for people from all walks of life to come together and interact.
-
-In fact, shopping malls are crucial drivers of Singapore's economy, offering a wide range of job opportunities in the retail and non-retail sectors. Singapore's malls attract a significant number of tourists who come to experience the city's vibrant shopping scene, contributing to Singapore's economy through their expenditure on retail, food, and accommodation. Shopping malls also play an essential role in creating a thriving retail industry that generates jobs and income for Singaporeans.
-
-Shopping malls play a critical role in Singapore's urban planning and development, forming part of larger integrated developments that include residential, office, and hotel components. These developments create a vibrant and diverse environment that provides a holistic experience for residents, workers, and visitors alike. They also contribute to the value of the surrounding properties, leading to a multiplier effect on the overall growth of the local economy. And free aircon is great.
-
-#### Best shopping malls in Singapore
-
-Criteria of assessment:
-+ Volume of shops
-+ Major brands available
-+ Food options
-+ Proximity to city center
-
-#### In order of best shopping experience (1 = best)
-
-1. Ion Orchard - Located on [Orchard Road](https://fromhktosg.github.io/neighbourhood/), this high-end mall features luxury brands and high street fashion. Some call it Orchard Ion
-2. Marina Bay Sands - This iconic mall boasts luxury brands, high-end restaurants, and stunning views of the Marina Bay
-3. Ngee Ann City / Takashimaya - Another popular shopping destination on Orchard Road, Takashimaya offers a range of products, from luxury brands to electronics and beauty products
-4. 313@Somerset - This mall offers a range of international and local brands, as well as a wide range of dining options
-5. VivoCity - One of the largest shopping malls in Singapore, VivoCity features a wide range of shops, restaurants, and entertainment options
-6. Suntec City - Located in the heart of the city, Suntec City offers a range of retail and entertainment options, as well as convention and exhibition facilities
-7. Jewel Changi Airport - This world-class mall features a stunning indoor waterfall, a vast array of shopping and dining options, and entertainment attraction
-8. IMM - popular destination for outlet shopping and home furnishing, located in the west of Singapore
-
-Other malls near the Heartlands include City Square mall, Queensway Shopping Center (great for sports items) and Raffles City Shopping Center.

-
-#### Loyalty programs
-
-An explosion of shopping mall loyalty programs have cropped up in the past few years. Along with loyalty points, malls have credit card partnerships that open up to further discounts. Here are a couple of examples -
-+ CapitaStar - offered by CapitaLand Malls, including malls such as Plaza Singapura, Bugis Junction, and Raffles City. American Express Platinum Credit Card offers 10X Membership Rewards points at participating malls under CapitaLand Malls
-+ Frasers Rewards - offered by Frasers Property Malls, including malls such as The Centrepoint, Causeway Point, and Northpoint City. Citi Rewards Card offers 4 miles per S$1 spent
-+ Changi Rewards - offered by Jewel Changi Airport and participating retailers in Changi Airport.
-+ Ion+ Rewards - offered by Ion Orchard, providing members with exclusive access to events, promotions, and rewards at the mall. Earn ION⁺ Points for every block of $100 same-day spend. 25 ION points convert to $10 ecapitavoucher. That means you get $10 back for $2500 of spend - pretty rough. 
-+ MBS Rewards - offered by Marina Bay Sands, providing members with exclusive discounts and privileges at the mall's shops, restaurants, and attractions. Each $1.2 Reward Dollar earned can be redeemed for $1 worth of goods and services at participating partners
-
-#### My two cents of shopping in Singapore versus in HK
-
-We’re referring to shopping for goods vs groceries here.
-
-+ Singapore is more expensive due to sales tax. Take Uniqlo in SG vs HK. Hong Kong is cheaper. Same with the US
-+ All the essential brands are there. For luxury, you’ll be able to get most of the latest items although they do run out quick
-+ There’s a lot less foot traffic versus Hong Kong. This makes shopping more comfortable and relaxing. This might change when tourists flood back in both countries
-+ Consistent quality of mid-tier shopping malls. Few large scale luxury malls exist, but for all the mid-tier ones, they are of consistent quality across the nation. Food options are similar and store options are similar
-+ Limited number of boutiques and thrifts
-
----
-
-My recommendation - only buy essentials or things that really catch your eye in Singapore. Buy luxury abroad for tax refund and buy staples and boutiques abroad for a wider selection at a lower price. If you really have to buy, I’d recommend going to MBS as the loyalty program is more friendly.  All that being said, Singapore’s shopping malls are some of the best in the world. With plenty of aircon to shelter from heat and a plethora of dining and shops options, shopping malls have become a haven and pastime for locals. I love my malls and so should you.

-title:  "2023 dating guide: Finding love in Singapore"
-categories: [Dating, Relationships, Marriage, Hong Kong, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/W.jpg
----
-A close expat friend of mine found herself caught in the twists and turns of the challenging Singapore dating scene. Despite her best efforts, meaningful connections seemed to elude her. The usual reasons creep in. ‘The best is already taken’, ‘It’s me, not you’, ‘Singapore’s too small to date’. Each disappointment weighed heavily on her heart. Frankly speaking, dating in Singapore is not easy and this is just one of few cases I’m aware of. Today, we’ll examine dating in Singapore including comparisons versus Hong Kong, casual dating and societal expectations. I’d preface - I’m no expert and nor am I experienced in this dating space. Let’s get started.
-
-Hong Kong and Singapore, two dynamic and cosmopolitan cities in Asia, offer unique dating experiences shaped by similar societal norms and cultural backgrounds. However, you don’t hear people complaining that ‘HK is boring’ when it comes to dating. Why’s that the case?
-
-<u> Comparing both countries - <u>
-+ Cultural Background: Singapore is a multicultural society with influences from Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western cultures. Hong Kong has a predominantly Chinese cultural background with Western influences. It’s much easier to find a mainland Chinese person to date in Hong Kong versus Singapore, whilst it’s much easier to find a Malay to date in Singapore versus Hong Kong. Both countries have expats so that’s one similarity.
-+ Casual dating is more common in Hong Kong: Because of the BTO housing system in Singapore, Singaporeans tend to get married earlier than Hong Kongers. This not only reduces the dating population in Singapore, but also means that dating is a little more serious. The exception to this is generally expats alongside a growing number of young adults.
-+ Work-Life Balance: Hong Kong is known for its fast-paced and competitive work environment, which can make it challenging to find time for dating. In Singapore, work-life balance is also valued, but the pace of life may be slightly more relaxed compared to Hong Kong.
-+ More fish in the ocean in Hong Kong: Perhaps the most important reason. Larger population, easier to date around
-+ Party scenes: LKF, Wan Chai, TST, speakeasies in HK. Clarke quay, boat quay in Singapore. The magnitude is just different and the party DNA is a lot wilder in HK.
-

-
-#### A gross summarization of the dating scene in Singapore
-
-In summary - dating apps, organic and Zouk. That’s a gross summarization. University is a big one where people meet their +1s. More on the dating apps later. Do people hook up? Yes. However, I’ve noticed that discussions and public displays of affection are generally not common due to conservative values. 
-
-#### Dating in Singapore is difficult though
-
-In 2021’s marriage and parenthood survey data, 50% were not currently dating. 38% of those who were not currently dating had never dated before (Annex B, Chart 8). Among those not currently dating, top reasons cited were having a limited social circle (58%), not having many opportunities to meet potential partners (57%), and their preference to leave dating to chance (48%).
-
-Other factors -
-+ Competitive Environment: Singapore is known for its highly competitive society, where individuals often prioritize education, career, and financial stability. As a result, people may have limited time and energy for dating, making it challenging to establish and maintain romantic relationships.
-+ High Cost of Living: Singapore has a relatively high cost of living, which can impact dating experiences. Planning and affording activities such as dinners, movies, or outings can be expensive, particularly for individuals on a tight budget
-+ Where do you have sex?: Most unmarried Singaporeans live with their parents. Unless the parents are progressive or are out of home, you’d have to find a different location to have sex. Staycations are popular here for obvious reasons
-+ Cultural Pressures and Expectations: Singaporean society places importance on family values and can have traditional expectations regarding relationships. This can create pressure to settle down at a certain age or follow societal norms, which can be challenging for those who prefer alternative dating styles or have unconventional preferences.
-+ Limited Social Circles: Singapore's small geographic size and fast-paced lifestyle can sometimes limit opportunities for meeting new people outside of established social circles. As a result, individuals may find it more challenging to expand their social networks and encounter potential dating partners.
-
-#### Societal pressures of getting married
-
-Related to dating difficulties is the pressure to get married
-
-Expectation 1: Timely Marriage:
-One prevailing societal expectation in Singapore is to get married at a "timely" age, often seen as late 20s to early 30s. Family, friends, and acquaintances may inquire about one's marital status, placing pressure on individuals to conform to this timeline. This expectation can be rooted in traditional values and a desire to maintain stability and continuation of family lineage. We’re slowly heading away from this as Singapore society gets more progressive, but it’ll take some time.
-
-Reality 1: Shifting Priorities:
-The reality is that individuals today prioritize personal growth, education, and career advancement. They may choose to delay marriage to establish financial stability or pursue personal goals. This shift challenges the traditional notion of timely marriage and emphasizes the importance of individual agency and fulfillment. Wokege.
-
-Expectation 2: Finding a Suitable Partner
-Singaporean society places importance on finding a "suitable" partner, often defined by factors such as education, occupation, and socio-economic status. This expectation can create pressure to meet societal standards, leading to a perception of limited options or the fear of being judged for unconventional choices.
-
-Reality 2: Diverse Definitions of Compatibility
-The reality is that compatibility cannot be reduced to a checklist of superficial criteria. Individuals today seek partners who share similar values, aspirations, and emotional compatibility. This broader perspective challenges societal expectations, allowing for more diverse and meaningful connections beyond external attributes.
-
-Expectation 3: Marriage as a Life Milestone
-Marriage is often seen as a significant life milestone in Singaporean society, symbolizing adulthood, stability, and success. The pressure to attain this milestone can stem from familial and social expectations, creating a sense of urgency to conform and avoid societal judgment.
-
-Reality 3: Multiple Pathways to Fulfillment:
-The reality is that marriage is not the only path to fulfillment. Many individuals prioritize personal growth, career achievements, and other life experiences. They challenge the notion that marriage is a prerequisite for happiness, focusing on individual goals and relationships beyond the traditional scope.
-
-Impact: Emotional and Mental Well-being:
-The societal pressures surrounding marriage in Singapore can have a significant impact on individuals' emotional and mental well-being. Constant inquiries, comparisons, and societal judgments can lead to anxiety, self-doubt, and feelings of inadequacy. It is crucial to recognize the emotional toll and foster a supportive environment that respects diverse choices.
-
-The discourse on societal pressures of getting married in Singapore reveals the clash between expectations and the realities faced by individuals. By acknowledging the shifting priorities, diverse definitions of compatibility, and multiple pathways to fulfillment, Singaporean society can foster a more inclusive and supportive environment. Empowering individuals to make choices aligned with their own aspirations and timelines will lead to a more progressive and understanding society.
-
-#### Government playing a part with the Singapore dating scene
-
-The Singapore government recognizes the importance of social relationships and has taken various initiatives to encourage dating and foster a conducive environment for individuals to meet and form connections. Here are some ways the Singapore government promotes dating:
-Social Development Network (SDN): The Social Development Network is a government agency established to promote social interaction and marriage within Singapore. SDN organizes events and activities, such as speed dating sessions, social mixers, and relationship workshops, to provide opportunities for singles to meet and connect.
-Funding and Support for Dating Events: The government provides funding and support for organizations that organize dating events and activities. This assistance helps create a diverse range of opportunities for singles to engage in social activities, attend matchmaking events, and participate in relationship-building programs.
-Online Dating Platforms: The government encourages the use of online dating platforms by partnering with reputable dating websites. These platforms provide a convenient and accessible way for singles to connect and find potential partners. The government promotes the use of safe and secure online platforms, emphasizing the importance of personal safety and responsible online behavior.
-Housing Policies: The government's housing policies also play a role in encouraging dating and marriage. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) offers various housing schemes and grants that incentivize young adults to settle down and form families. These policies aim to provide affordable housing options for couples and support the institution of marriage.
-Public Awareness Campaigns: The government conducts public awareness campaigns to promote dating and healthy relationships. These campaigns focus on educating individuals about the importance of social interaction, communication skills, and building meaningful connections. They also aim to break down stereotypes and encourage individuals to be more open-minded in their dating preferences.
-
-#### Do dating apps work in Singapore?
-
-Yes and no. All the dating apps are in town so let’s break them down -
-Tinder - the OG of dating apps. You swipe right if you like someone and left if you're not feeling it. It's known for casual flings and hook-ups globally. No difference in Singapore
-Bumble - Ladies take the lead here. Once you match, the ladies gotta make the first move within 24 hours. Good luck to all you men
-Coffee Meets Bagel - They send you a limited number of matches (aka "bagels") every day. Quality over quantity, they say. It's for those who want something more meaningful
-OkCupid - all about compatibility. They've got this fancy algorithm that matches you based on your preferences and values. Plus, you can answer a bunch of questions to improve your match quality
-Paktor - Popular in Southeast Asia, including Singapore. They've got cool features like virtual gifting and group chats. It's got a diverse user base and caters to different preference
-Happn - It's all about those chance encounters. Happn matches you with people you've crossed paths with in real life. It's perfect for those who believe in serendipity.
-
-Remember, these apps might change over time, so it's good to give a few a try and see which one suits your dating style and goals. I know multiple friends who met their now-wife through dating apps. It's possible. One thing I have to call out is for both Hong Kong and Singapore, my expat friends all say they have an advantage in casual dating over the local population. Call it yellow fever or asian girls liking expat guys, but this is an existing phenomenon.
-
-What about matchmaking? It’s a well-established practice but not the most common.
-
-#### Popular date spots in Singapore
-
-It really depends what kind of couple you are but here’s a general list of the evergreen generic ones. Personally, I’d love to check Time Out and Vogue for ‘what to do this weekend in Singapore’ as they have curated lists of events happening in town. That’s a much better approach
-
-+ Hiking at MacRitchie Reservoir: Explore the lush greenery and scenic trails around the reservoir. It's a great way to enjoy nature together and have a peaceful and active date.
-+ Katong and Joo Chiat: Take a stroll through these charming neighborhoods known for their rich heritage, colorful Peranakan shophouses, and delicious local food. It's a hidden gem for an authentic and cultural experience. East coast adventures.
-+ Kranji Countryside: Escape the city and visit the tranquil Kranji countryside. Explore the farms, go on a nature walk, or enjoy a cozy meal at one of the farm-to-table restaurants. It's a unique and serene setting for a date. I love a trip to Bollywood veggies
-+ The Projector: Watch an indie or classic film at this independent cinema located in an old-school building. It's a cozy and nostalgic experience that movie lovers would appreciate.
-+ Art Jamming or pottery at a Studio: Get creative together and unleash your artistic side at an art jamming studio. It's a fun and interactive date where you can paint and express yourselves.
-+ Gardens by the Bay: Take a romantic stroll through the stunning gardens and Supertree Grove. Don't miss the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories.
-+ Sentosa Island: Relax on the beautiful beaches, visit Universal Studios Singapore, or try thrilling water sports. One of my favourite places to kick it
-+ Singapore Botanic Gardens: Explore the lush greenery, have a picnic by the Swan Lake, or visit the National Orchid Garden.
-+ Shopping: Depends if you want to splurge but shopping at Ion / MBS can’t really go wrong.
-
-<u> Summing it up <u>
-
-In this fast-paced dance of love, time is precious, but commitment is held dear. Singapore's dating scene is a whirlwind of efficiency and heartfelt connections, where couples envision a future hand-in-hand. Would I prefer dating in Hong Kong or dating in Singapore? Obviously the former. But it's not that bad in Singapore.

-
-In an earlier article, we discussed the lack of things to do in Singapore. Well, one activity that many locals engage in is sports. Sports facilities in a nation showcase its commitment to promoting health and well-being, investing in infrastructure development, nurturing a sporting culture, and fostering community engagement and social inclusion. Today, we will delve into sports facilities in Singapore, exploring their purpose, accessibility for the public and private sectors, and the top venues available.
-
-#### Singapore's Commitment to Sports
-
-Singapore is truly committed to the sporting scene. Well-maintained and accessible facilities demonstrate a focus on physical fitness and recreational opportunities, while modern and diverse facilities signify investment in infrastructure and a vibrant sports scene. World-class facilities contribute to a nation's competitive sporting achievements, while inclusive facilities promote community engagement and equal opportunities for participation. Collectively, sports facilities serve as visible symbols of a nation's dedication to promoting an active lifestyle, supporting athletic development, and enhancing the overall quality of life for its citizens.

-According to Sport Singapore's "Sport Participation Survey 2019," it was reported that 84% of Singapore residents aged 15 years and above participated in sports or physical exercise at least once a week. This indicates a significant number of Singaporeans actively involved in sports and recreational activities.
-
-#### Singapore's Public Sports Facilities
-
-With over 40 stadiums, more than 120 community sports centers, and a network of well-designed parks and recreational areas, the city offers a diverse range of spaces to accommodate different sports and cater to varying levels of expertise. However, despite having these sports facilities, Singapore has yet to make a significant impact on the world's sports stage (aside from Joseph Schooling's exceptional performance).
-At the heart of Singapore's sporting landscape stands the magnificent Singapore Sports Hub, a world-class integrated sports and entertainment complex. The hub's centerpiece, the National Stadium, boasts a capacity of 55,000 and has hosted major international events, including the Southeast Asian Games and international football matches. It is here that we witness the unifying power of sport, as the cheers of fans reverberate through the stands, creating an electric atmosphere that ignites the spirit within.
-While the Singapore Sports Hub showcases the pinnacle of sports infrastructure, it is the community sports centers that form the backbone of grassroots sporting engagement. With more than 120 centers strategically located across the island, these facilities offer a wide range of amenities, including basketball courts, swimming pools, futsal courts, football fields, tennis courts, and fitness gyms. They serve as the beating heart of local communities, providing accessible and inclusive spaces for everyone to participate in sports activities. From children honing their skills to seniors staying active, these centers embody the spirit of camaraderie and play.
-
-In a bustling city where green spaces are treasured, parks and recreational areas offer a respite for those seeking a closer connection to nature while engaging in physical activities. Singapore's meticulously designed parks, such as the iconic East Coast Park and the sprawling Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, provide an abundance of options for outdoor sports and recreation. Jogging trails, cycling paths, fitness corners, and skate parks are thoughtfully integrated, creating a haven for active living amidst the urban landscape. These green havens offer a unique blend of serenity and vitality, where individuals can exercise while immersing themselves in the beauty of nature.

-#### Sports facilities in condo
-
-A big reason why people live in condos is because of the so called ‘amenities’. This generally breaks down to a pool, a gym and if you’re lucky, a tennis court. Sports facilities in condominiums have become increasingly popular, offering residents the convenience of accessing recreational activities right at their doorstep. I love my condo's pool, especially in the hot Singapore weather.
-
-In the older condos that are larger, for example Mandarin Gardens, you’d find a larger range of sports facilities, for example a standard 25m pool, snooker tables, squash and table tennis courts and even a Mahjong room (we classify this as a sport too).
-
-The presence of sports facilities in condominiums adds value to the overall living experience.
-
-#### What about country clubs...
-
-Singapore's country clubs boast an impressive array of sports facilities, catering to a wide range of athletic interests. From golf courses designed by renowned architects to world-class tennis courts and state-of-the-art swimming pools, these clubs leave no stone unturned when it comes to sporting amenities. Additionally, you can find well-equipped fitness centers, squash courts, badminton courts, and even bowling alleys. Whether you're a golf enthusiast, a tennis aficionado, or simply seeking a great workout, Singapore's country clubs offer top-notch facilities to elevate your sports experience. Shit’s expensive but if it fits your lifestyle, why not? We’ll cover this in more detail another time.
-
-In conclusion, Singapore offers a wide range of public sports facilities that cater to various sports and recreational activities. These facilities are strategically located throughout the country, providing accessible spaces for residents and visitors to engage in physical fitness, competitive sports, and leisurely pursuits. The well-maintained facilities reflect Singapore's commitment to promoting an active lifestyle, nurturing sporting talents, and fostering a vibrant sports culture. With state-of-the-art stadiums, swimming complexes, sports halls, and outdoor spaces, Singapore provides ample opportunities for individuals to pursue their athletic passions, stay fit, and enjoy the benefits of sports and recreation.

-title:  "Hong Kong versus Singapore: same food items, different taste"
-categories: [Food, hawker center, restaurants, surprise, Hong Kong, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/chasiu.jpg
----
-When I first arrived in Singapore, I recall ordering barbecue pork rice at a hawker center, thinking it would taste like the same comforting dish I had in Hong Kong. However, after receiving my plate of food, I found the dish surprisingly different. The cha siu was thinly sliced versus thickly sliced, there was too much sauce and the sauce was too sweet and viscous. In fact, a barbeque pork rice in San Francisco drew a much closer comparison to that of Hong Kong’s. In today’s post, we’ll dissect some iconic differences between Hong Kong Chinese cuisine versus Singapore Chinese cuisine. For best comparison, we’ll use that of a Cha Chaan Teng / Maxim’s in Hong Kong versus that of a hawker center / coffee shop in Singapore so we can get closest to what the general population consumes on a day to day. Of course, the food items will be much more similar in an authentic higher end eatery in both countries, but that won’t be our focus for today. In case you missed my earlier post on the best [dim sum in Singapore](https://fromhktosg.github.io/dimsum/), check it out too.
-
-#### History behind Hong Kong versus Singapore Chinese cuisine
-
-Chinese cuisine is renowned worldwide for its rich flavors, diverse ingredients, and culinary traditions that have evolved over centuries. Two prominent centers of Chinese culinary excellence are Hong Kong and Singapore. Both regions boast a vibrant and distinct Chinese food culture that reflects their unique historical, cultural, and geographical contexts. 
-
-Chinese immigrants began settling in Hong Kong during the early colonial period, bringing their culinary traditions with them. Hong Kong’s cuisine is heavily influenced by Cantonese culinary traditions, renowned for its finesse, subtle flavors, and emphasis on fresh ingredients. It stands out with its delicate cooking techniques, preserving the natural taste and texture of ingredients. The cuisine showcases a wide range of ingredients, including seafood, poultry, and exotic delicacies, creating a harmonious balance of flavors and textures. Light seasonings, such as soy sauce and fermented ingredients, enhance the natural flavors without overpowering them. Simply exquisite.
-
-Chinese cuisine entered Singapore through a combination of historical factors, migration, and cultural exchanges. Chinese immigrants from various regions, such as Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan, brought their culinary traditions when they settled in Singapore. Additionally, Singapore has developed its own blend of Chinese cuisine, infused with Malay, Indian, and Peranakan influences. Hence, the cuisine incorporates an additional array of herbs, spices, and sauces in their dishes.
-
-#### Let’s start off with seasoning behind the two cuisines
-
-When my parents visited Singapore two years back, they commented that ‘Singapore Chinese food is like Hong Kong Chinese food 25 years back. Oilier, saltier, heavier, bolder and more fragrant.’ Basically, more flavourful. A couple of things that I notice from hawker centers that may be surprising to Hong Kong visitors or expats -
-
-+ Jalapenos - everybody asks for Jalapenos. These are green chilis that are pickled and sliced and go well with any noodle or rice based dish. I love the pickled jalapenos in Singapore as they add a burst of flavour to your meal
-+ Chili - everybody asks for Chili. By chili, we mean this as something like 豆瓣醬 without the fermented bean paste in. Think something similar to Lao gan ma without the additional crispiness. Singaporeans love their spice and chili adds an extra dimension to the dish. To be fair, this is something you’ll also find in Hong Kong Cha Chaan Tengs
-+ Gravy - aka more sauce. This can be curry if you’re eating a Hainan curry rice, or more 勾芡 (mostly chicken soup thickened by starch) on a rice noodle dish. Locals love their gravy and often ask for their dishes to be drenched in it. Not the most refined approach but hey, people are saucy. I much prefer a moderate amount instead of having food all slathered by sauce
-+ Soy sauce - it’s not uncommon to see soy sauce in a tub or little bag with diced up red chilis inside. Be it with soup noodles or rice, people want their soy sauce to their dish. It’s horrible for your sodium levels but the takeaway is Singaporeans love their bold flavours
-
-#### Same same but different food dishes
-
-On to food dishes that share the same name but are executed differently.
-
-<u> Carrot cake (蘿蔔糕) <u>
-
-Hong Kong’ers are familiar with our usual rectangular block carrot cakes that we get at the usual dim sum establishments. Singapore carrot cake is different. Singapore carrot cake, or chai tow kway, differs from Hong Kong carrot cake in both preparation and flavor. Singapore carrot cake is stir-fried and made with cubes of radish cake, resulting in a soft yet slightly crispy texture. It is seasoned with a combination of sauces, including soy sauce and oyster sauce, and often spiced up with chili paste. On the other hand, Hong Kong carrot cake is steamed, sliced, and then pan-fried, offering a firmer texture and a subtle sweet and savory taste. The two versions showcase distinct cooking methods and flavor profiles, highlighting the diverse culinary variations within Chinese cuisine.
-
-| ![Carrotcake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/carrotcake.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Radish and flour cubes pressed and fried together with egg and scallions*  |
-
-<u> Barbeque pork (叉燒) <u>
-
-Let me be clear here. There’s some damn good cha siu in Singapore. I’ve talked about Jiang Nan Chun before for traditional cha siu, and Fook Kin is another one of my favourites for a more modern twist to cha siu. All that being said, if you visit a generic hawker store i.e. to a wanton chasiu noodle store, the cha siu you will get will differ from an ingredient selection standpoint and a technique standpoint. 
-+ Thinly sliced versus thickly sliced
-+ Leaner versus fattier
-+ Dyed artificially red
-+ No honey glaze
-+ Rice will be drenched with soy sauce
-
-Pretty much, the Singapore version is a more stripped down version of the Hong Kong iteration given slimmer margins of operations as well. If you are from Hong Kong, you will notice the difference versus a HK barbeque meat (燒臘) shop. The same applies to pork belly. A much thinner and leaner cut.
-
-| ![Fookin]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/chasiu.jpg)
-|:--:| 
-|  *Fook Kin. The thick cut slices that you usually find in Hong Kongd*  |
-
-<u> Fried Rice (炒飯) <u>
-
-If we want to be more specific, let’s compare yangzhou fried rice (揚州炒飯). Yangzhou fried rice is a flavorful Chinese dish made with ingredients such as diced cha siu, shrimp, eggs, carrots, peas, and green onions. The ingredients are stir-fried together with soy sauce, oyster sauce, and seasonings. At least that’s what we’re familiar with in Hong Kong. In Singapore. In Singapore, a lot of the core ingredients are stripped away. Again, an adaptation to maintain margins given prices are so much cheaper in Singapore. You’re usually left with tiny pieces of cha siu, scallions and eggs. This is not a critique to the dish itself, but just a heads up of the differences. All that being said, wok hey is still there and taste is just fine.
-
-<u> Congee <u>
-
-Singapore congee, often known as "bubur," features a rich and thick consistency with a wide range of ingredients. It is typically cooked with long-grain rice and a variety of meats, such as chicken, pork, or seafood. Singaporean-style congee incorporates various herbs, spices, and condiments to enhance the flavor, such as ginger, garlic, fried shallots, and soy sauce. The result is a flavorful and hearty porridge, often served with additional toppings like century eggs, sliced spring onions, and crispy fried dough fritters (you tiao). In contrast, Hong Kong congee, also known as "jook," tends to have a smoother and silkier texture. It is traditionally made with short-grain rice, which creates a softer consistency. Hong Kong-style congee is typically simpler in terms of ingredients, often featuring just a few key components such as lean pork or fish. The focus is on the delicate and subtle flavors of the main ingredient, allowing the natural taste of the rice and meat to shine.
-
-It fascinates me how these basic dishes all have their own local twists to it. They’re all delicious too.
-
-#### A little on dining know-hows
-
-Small little things on dining know-hows caught my attention after visiting hawker centers a few times. 
-
-+ Water / tea is not free: It usually is for a cha chaan teng but not in a coffee shop / hawker center in Singapore
-+ You have to busk: Saves labour cost especially in community eateries
-Portion size flexibility: You have the ability to select your meal size. Small rice? $4. Medium rice? $4.5. Large rice? $5
-+ Plastic bags for drinks: Drinking coffee? Have it in a plastic bag. Obviously, it’s a plastic bag tailored for a drink and you stick a straw through it but it’s definitely old school
-+ Wet towels / tissue: Bring your own. If you dine in a coffee shop and they have a wet wipe, it’ll most likely cost you money
-
-I hope this post shows the little nuances between basic food items and dining experiences between Hong Kong and Singapore. What other differences have you noticed? Comment in your thoughts. Subscribe now to see more content like this.

-title:  "Tuition addiction: Unpacking tuition in Singapore"
-categories: [Education, tuition, Hong Kong, Singapore, parents]
-image: assets/images/bamboo.jpg
----
-
-During a casual lunch with a friend, I was taken aback when he revealed that he spends a staggering $1000 SGD per month on tuition for his 5-year-old child, highlighting the extent to which some parents prioritize academic enrichment from an early age. My friend’s kid seemed like a smart one - why drill more knowledge in her from such a young age? In an earlier post, I touched on the education system in Singapore and Hong Kong. Both countries place great emphasis on academic excellence, leading to a thriving tuition landscape in both regions. The perception of tuition being ingrained as a necessity by parents has sparked debates on its potential negative impact on children's well-being and overall education system. In today’s post, we’ll dive into the emergence of tuition, effects the industry has on parents and children and a comparison of the top tuition centers and their marketing tactics in Hong Kong and Singapore. I'd say tuition is more common with locals, but an increasing number of expats in Singapore is exploring this. In case you missed out, check out my [earlier article](https://fromhktosg.github.io/education/) on the education system of Singapore and how it fares against Hong Kong.
-
-#### Emergence of tuition as an industry
-
-<u> Hong Kong <u>
-
-The first tuition center in Hong Kong is believed to be Modern Education, established in 1971 by Mr. Lam Wing-kee. Initially, it aimed to provide supplementary education to students who needed extra assistance. Over time, tuition centers gained popularity due to the competitive nature of the education system and the desire for academic excellence. They became more mainstream in the 1980s and 1990s as the demand for additional academic support grew. Today, tuition centers are a common feature of the education landscape in Hong Kong, catering to students of all ages and academic levels.
-
-<u> Singapore <u>
-
-Tuition centers started emerging in Singapore in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As the education system became more competitive, the demand for additional academic support outside of school grew. This led to the establishment of the first tuition centers, which offered supplementary classes and coaching to help students excel in their studies. Over the years, the tuition industry in Singapore has continued to expand and evolve, with a wide range of centers catering to various subjects and academic levels.
-
-#### Why send your children to tuition in Singapore?
-
-TL;DR - helicopter parents are stressed about their kids not being superstars so they’ll do everything to give their kids a boost
-
-+ Academic Excellence: Tuition is seen as a pathway to help children achieve better academic results and excel in their studies.
-+ Supplementing School Education: Tuition provides additional support beyond the regular school curriculum, helping students understand challenging subjects or topics.
-+ Competitive Academic Environment: Singapore's competitive education system motivates parents to enroll their children in tuition to gain a competitive edge over their peers.
-+ Confidence Building: Tuition boosts students' confidence by providing personalized attention, addressing their weaknesses, and enhancing their understanding of subjects.
-+ Individualized Learning: Tuition offers a customized learning experience, catering to each child's unique learning style, pace, and specific needs.
-+ Addressing Learning Gaps: Tuition helps bridge any knowledge gaps, ensuring students keep up with the rigorous curriculum and stay on track with their peers.
-+ Enrichment Opportunities: Tuition can provide enrichment activities, projects, and resources that go beyond the school syllabus, broadening students' knowledge and skills.
-+ Holistic Development: Some parents see tuition as a means to foster holistic development, focusing on critical thinking, problem-solving, and cultivating a passion for learning.
-+ Exam Preparation: Tuition centers often specialize in exam preparation, equipping students with effective study strategies, exam techniques, and practice materials.
-+ Parental Expectations: Parents may send their kids to tuition due to societal and parental expectations, believing that it is essential for their children's academic success.
-
-#### How do these tuition centers teach?
-
-Every format you can think of. Depending on whether it's catered to local Singaporeans or expats in Singapore, they can differ given a preference for smaller class size for the former. Listing a few here - 
-
-+ One-on-one sessions: Personalized attention and focused guidance.
-+ Group classes: Opportunities for interaction and peer learning.
-+ Large classes: A cost-effective option with a diverse learning environment.
-+ Recordings: Flexibility to revisit lessons and review materials.
-+ Mass streaming: Access to educational content on a larger scale.
-+ Hybrid models: Combination of in-person and online teaching for flexibility.
-+ Online platforms: Convenient and accessible learning experience.
-+ Classroom-based: Traditional setting with teacher-student interaction.
-+ Tutorial centers: Dedicated centers for subject-specific instruction.
-+ Home tuition: Individualized teaching in a familiar environment.
-+ Online tutoring: Virtual tutoring sessions for remote learning.
-+ Exam-focused crash courses: Intensive courses for exam preparation.
-+ Subject-specific coaching: Specialized instruction to enhance understanding.
-+ Remedial tuition: Targeted support for students who need extra help.
-+ Enrichment programs: Supplementary classes to broaden knowledge and skills.
-+ Preparatory classes: Preparation for educational transitions and exams.
-
-Covid accelerated the online models, and as shown in kdramas, you’ll get masses of students listening to a tutor livestream their teachings.
-
-#### Tuition in relations to Gifted Education Program in Singapore
-
-One ting expats in Singapore may not know is that many go through tuition to get into a Gifted Education Program in Singapore. A Gifted Education Program (GEP) is a specialized educational program designed to meet the needs of academically gifted or talented students. It aims to provide a more challenging and enriched learning experience for students who demonstrate exceptional abilities in intellectual, creative, or specific academic domains. Funnily enough, those who get into GEP continue with education
-
-The specific structure and implementation of GEP may vary between countries and educational systems. In general, however, the program identifies gifted students through various assessment methods, such as standardized tests, teacher recommendations, or portfolio assessments. Once identified, these students are offered specialized instruction and curriculum that goes beyond the standard curriculum provided to their peers.
-
-Gifted education programs often feature accelerated learning, in-depth study of subjects, problem-solving activities, and opportunities for creativity and critical thinking. They may involve small class sizes, specialized teachers, and access to resources and enrichment activities not typically available in regular classrooms.
-
-The goals of a Gifted Education Program are to nurture the talents and potential of gifted students, provide appropriate intellectual stimulation, foster their social and emotional development, and support their overall growth. These programs aim to challenge gifted students academically, help them reach their full potential, and prepare them for future academic and professional success.
-
-Gifted education programs can be found at various levels of education, ranging from primary and secondary schools to higher education institutions. The specific criteria for eligibility and the nature of the program may differ based on the country's educational policies and practices.
-
-It is important to note that gifted education programs are designed to meet the unique needs of gifted students and provide them with an educational environment that supports their advanced abilities. The aim is to ensure that gifted students are appropriately challenged, engaged, and given opportunities to thrive academically and personally.
-
-#### So how much is spent on tuition?
-
-The average spend on tuition in Singapore and Hong Kong varies based on factors such as the level of education, subjects, and the individual preferences of students and parents. In Singapore, where tuition is highly prevalent, the average monthly expenditure on tuition can range from SGD 200 to SGD 1,000 or more, depending on the grade level and intensity of the tuition sought. Some families may spend even higher amounts for specialized programs or individual tutoring. Here are a few stats for Singapore - 1) In 2019, Singapore families spent $1.4b on private tuition for kids last year, 2) 70% of parents send their child for tuition. 8 in 10 Primary school students and 6 in 10 Secondary school students pay for private tuition. This sounds pretty unhealthy to me, given the dollars and time invested.
-
-In Hong Kong, the average spend on tuition is also significant, reflecting the competitive academic environment. The monthly expenditure on tuition can range from HKD 1,000 to HKD 5,000 or higher. Like in Singapore, the costs can vary based on the grade level, subjects, and the reputation and quality of the tuition center or private tutor.
-
-It's important to note that these figures are approximate averages and can vary significantly depending on individual circumstances. Factors such as the number of subjects, frequency of tuition sessions, and the specific educational goals of students and parents can influence the overall expenditure on tuition.
-
-Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that the tuition landscape in both Singapore and Hong Kong is highly diverse, with a wide range of options available at various price points. Families have the flexibility to choose from group tuition, private tutoring, online platforms, and specialized programs, each with its own cost structure.
-
-Overall, while tuition can be a substantial financial commitment for families in both Singapore and Hong Kong, it is considered a valuable investment in students' academic success and future prospects. The average spend on tuition reflects the importance placed on education and the willingness of parents to provide additional support to enhance their children's learning experiences.
-
-#### Negative effects of tuition and enrichment centers
-
-Listing just a few…
-
-+ Increased Academic Pressure:
-Statistics from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) showed that Singaporean students reported higher levels of academic pressure compared to their international counterparts.
-According to a survey conducted by the National Youth Council, around 90% of students in Singapore feel stressed about academic performance.
-
-+ Impact on Mental Health:
-The Institute of Mental Health reported that about 1 in 7 students aged 13 to 16 in Singapore experienced significant symptoms of anxiety and depression.
-A study by the National University of Singapore found that high-stress levels due to academic pressure were associated with higher rates of mental health issues among students.
-
-+ Reduced Creativity and Well-Rounded Development:
-The emphasis on academic achievement and structured learning in enrichment centers may limit opportunities for students to explore their creativity and develop a well-rounded skill set.
-The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that Singaporean students had lower levels of creative problem-solving skills compared to their international peers.
-
-+ Financial Burden:
-Enrichment programs can be expensive, adding to the financial burden on families. According to a survey by the Singapore Department of Statistics, education expenses accounted for a significant portion of household expenditure.
-
-+ Educational Inequality:
-Higher-income families have greater access to enrichment centers, creating educational disparities between socioeconomic groups. This may perpetuate inequality and hinder equal opportunities for academic success.
-
-I’m sure parents know of these reasons already, but it’s just part of Singapore society now. Tuition centers have woven themselves into the very fabric of Singapore, perpetuating a culture of excessive academic pressure and fostering a dependency on external help for success. This pervasive reliance on tuition has created a system where students feel inadequate without constant supplementary support, breeding a sense of insecurity and stifling their true potential.
-
-#### Top tuition centers in Hong Kong and Singapore
-
-Top Tuition Centers in Hong Kong: In Hong Kong, several prominent tuition centers have established themselves as leaders in the industry. For instance, Beacon College, known for its strong track record in helping students excel in examinations, offers comprehensive programs and experienced tutors. Similarly, Modern Education, with its personalized approach and small class sizes, aims to provide individual attention to students. These centers employ marketing tactics such as testimonials from successful students, showcasing their achievements and emphasizing the effectiveness of their teaching methods. They also organize workshops and seminars to engage parents and highlight their centers' expertise.
-
-Top Tuition Centers in Singapore: Likewise, Singapore boasts several renowned tuition centers that have gained popularity among students and parents. The Learning Lab, known for its structured curriculum and highly qualified tutors, focuses on holistic development and academic excellence. Another notable center is MindChamps, which combines academic enrichment with character development, offering a unique approach to education. These centers employ marketing strategies such as informative websites, featuring their success stories and testimonials from satisfied parents. They also leverage social media platforms and collaborate with schools to enhance their visibility and reputation.
-
-#### Marketing tactics of these tuition centers
-
-Let’s switch gears and discuss the marketing tactics of tuition centers.
-
-In a predatory manner, tuition centers in both Hong Kong and Singapore employ manipulative marketing tactics to prey on students and their parents. Exploiting the fears and insecurities surrounding academic success, these centers boast about their high success rates, using testimonials and selective statistics to lure in vulnerable students. By forging partnerships with schools and leveraging online platforms, they establish an air of legitimacy and credibility, deceiving parents into believing that their services are necessary for their child's educational advancement. These profit-driven establishments capitalize on the educational anxiety of families, perpetuating a toxic cycle of dependency and extracting financial gains at the expense of students' well-being.
-
-I see photos of young adults and their grades littered across mall banners, bus ads and building displays in Singapore. Great marketing, not healthy for society.
-
-#### How is the industry regulated?
-
-Both Hong Kong and Singapore have regulations in place regarding tuition centers to ensure quality education and safeguard the interests of students.
-
-In Hong Kong, tuition centers are governed by the Education Bureau (EDB) and are required to register with the government. The Education Ordinance sets out guidelines for tuition centers, including requirements for proper facilities, qualified teachers, and adherence to safety regulations. The EDB conducts inspections and imposes penalties for non-compliance or operating without registration.
-
-Similarly, in Singapore, tuition centers are regulated by the Ministry of Education (MOE). Tuition centers must comply with the Private Education Act and the Committee for Private Education (CPE) regulations. They need to be registered with the MOE or be exempted from registration. The MOE monitors tuition centers to ensure they meet the necessary standards, including teacher qualifications, premises safety, and appropriate pedagogical practices.
-
-Both jurisdictions also have regulations in place to prevent excessive advertising and misleading claims by tuition centers. Advertisements must be accurate, transparent, and adhere to guidelines set by the respective authorities. This is to protect consumers, particularly parents and students, from false or exaggerated promises.
-
-These regulations aim to maintain the quality and integrity of tuition services, ensuring that students receive effective and reliable educational support. By imposing standards on tuition centers, the authorities seek to safeguard the educational well-being of students and promote a fair and transparent learning environment.
-
-#### Is tuition an addiction?
-
-Yes. Tuition has become an addiction in many educational systems, including in Hong Kong and Singapore. The intense pressure to excel academically, coupled with the fear of falling behind, has created a culture where students and parents alike feel compelled to rely on tuition as a crutch. This addiction is fueled by the belief that extra classes and constant studying are the only pathways to success, leaving little room for personal growth, hobbies, or a balanced lifestyle. Students become dependent on the constant validation and reassurance that tuition provides, fearing that without it, they will lose their competitive edge. The addictive nature of tuition perpetuates a cycle of high expectations, stress, and burnout, ultimately undermining the intrinsic joy of learning and stifling individual creativity and curiosity.
-
-My recommendation to parents is to let the kids learn through school and self study and if they are really struggling in some subjects or want a leg up in another, then explore tuition as an option. Don’t put your kids through enrichment classes every evening. Let them play, enjoy themselves and build knowledge through their own curiosity.

-title:  "10 reasons to move to Singapore"
-categories: [Immigration, move, relocation, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/movetosg.jpg
----
-
-I have been asked many times what the main reasons are for moving to Singapore. I discussed my personal reasons in an earlier post, but that was based on my pre-move conception of the country. Now, after residing here for 5 years and witnessing the experiences of expats in Singapore, as well as interacting with locals, I can confidently state that there are clear-cut reasons for choosing to move to Singapore. With that in mind, I present to you my top ten reasons for living in Singapore.
-
-1. Strong Economy: Singapore's robust and thriving economy is one of the key reasons why many people choose to move here. As a global financial hub, the city-state provides abundant job opportunities in sectors such as finance, technology, healthcare, and logistics. Its business-friendly environment and supportive infrastructure make it an attractive destination for professionals seeking career growth. Singapore is also a stable nation that many value. The job opportunity I’ve had here parallels that of the US and is stronger than that of Hong Kong.
-
-2. Safety and Security: No country is safer than Singapore. No one will deny this. Singapore consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, with low crime rates and efficient law enforcement. You can enjoy peace of mind and a secure environment for yourself and your family. Worried about going home at 3am? That’s not a concern in Singapore. Worried about getting pickpocketed on the train? That’s not a concern in Singapore. Worried about your kids being kidnapped from a park? That’s not a concern in Singapore. This is the biggest reason of why expats want to move to Singapore
-
-3. Excellent Infrastructure: Singapore boasts world-class infrastructure, which is essential for a comfortable and convenient lifestyle. From a well-connected public transportation system to efficient public services, you'll find that everything runs smoothly in this city-state. The MRT (subway) connects all over the island and is still expanding its presence with new train lines being built. Well-maintained roads, advanced healthcare facilities, and modern amenities contribute to a high standard of living. I
-
-4. Cultural Diversity: One of Singapore's greatest assets is its cultural diversity. With a mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western influences, the city-state embraces a multicultural society. This diversity is evident in its vibrant festivals, mouthwatering cuisine, and traditional customs. Living in Singapore means being part of a rich tapestry of cultures and enjoying a truly global experience. Is there racism? Yes. But that’s in any country, especially if you are an expat there. Are there clashes because of cultures and race? Yes. But that’s in any country as well. If anything, Singapore does a great job in maintaining racial harmony.
-
-5. Education System: If you have children or are pursuing higher education, Singapore's renowned education system will be of great interest. The city-state is home to top-ranking universities (NUS broke into the top 10 in the world this year I believe), international schools, and well-structured academic programs. The emphasis on quality education ensures that students receive a solid foundation for their future success. For expats, Singapore international schools are some of the top notch in the world (see more about education here). The local education system is intense, but that’s why you send your child to private or international school if you can afford it. The same applies to other countries
-
-6. Clean: Despite being a bustling urban center, Singapore is committed to maintaining a clean and green environment. The government's strict environmental policies have resulted in well-managed parks, gardens, and nature reserves. You can enjoy green spaces, pristine streets, and a city that takes pride in its cleanliness. Now, it’s almost hysterical to complain about this but all the cleanliness takes away from the grunge that any country should have. However, this is about reasons to live in Singapore, and cleanliness is apparent
-
-7. Healthcare Excellence: Singapore's healthcare system is world-class, with state-of-the-art medical facilities and highly skilled healthcare professionals. The country consistently ranks among the best in terms of healthcare outcomes and accessibility. You can have peace of mind knowing that quality healthcare services are readily available when you need them. Private and public healthcare is both amazing too. The country is tiny so a hospital is always at arms reach. Doctors are all quality (even the GPs though they look miserable) and it’s a luxury locals and expats in Singapore always forget
-
-8. Food and Dining: Prepare your taste buds for an unforgettable culinary adventure in Singapore. The city-state is renowned for its diverse food scene, offering a wide range of cuisines to satisfy every palate. From affordable street food at hawker centers to Michelin-starred restaurants, you'll discover a gastronomic paradise where culinary delights await at every turn. I love that you can eat cheap if you want and then eat expensive the next day if that’s what you desire. Moving here for the food isn’t something people usually think about but it’s an unassuming luxury too. The issue with Singapore right now is that there are too many medium-priced food establishments that are not worth, but it takes time to really find what restaurants should be on your blacklist.
-
-9. Travel Opportunities: Singapore's strategic location in Southeast Asia makes it an ideal base for exploring the region. With excellent connectivity and transportation links, you can easily travel to neighboring countries and immerse yourself in diverse cultures, stunning landscapes, and unique experiences. Satiate your wanderlust and embark on exciting adventures just a short distance away. You’ll be able to get some great flight deals from this SEA hub too. I averaged 15-20 trips prior to COVID and now 5-7 trips post COVID. All from the heart of Singapore. 
-
-10. Quality of Life: Ultimately, moving to Singapore promises a high quality of life. With efficient public services, good infrastructure, a safe environment, and various amenities, you can enjoy a comfortable and prosperous lifestyle. Singapore consistently ranks well in global quality of life indexes, reflecting its commitment to providing a thriving and inclusive community for residents. Yes, the cost of living is high but taxes are low. You have the choice to live lavishly or not.
-
-If you're seeking a dynamic and cosmopolitan city that offers tremendous opportunities, a diverse culture, and an excellent standard of living, Singapore could be the perfect destination for you. From its strong economy to its safe environment, world-class healthcare, and culinary delights, Singapore has much to offer. Consider these 10 compelling reasons as you contemplate your next chapter in life. I’ve talked about Singapore’s weaknesses. It’s time to talk about Singapore’s strengths too.

-title:  "Guide to Singapore's healthcare system: Public vs Private"
-categories: [Healthcare, hospitals, cost of living, Hong Kong, Singapore]
-image: assets/images/supportsystems.jpg
----
-The pandemic’s over. Wahoo! Singapore’s healthcare system, renowned for its efficiency, quality, and accessibility, was put under the spotlight during the past 3 years of COVID. This post explores the distinctions between private and public healthcare in Singapore, examining factors such as cost, accessibility, and quality of care. Additionally, it delves into the remuneration of doctors in Singapore, shedding light on their earning potential and the considerations surrounding their salaries. Oh, you'll also find out about the best hospitals and where you can find them. By understanding the dynamics of Singapore's healthcare landscape, we gain insights into the complex interplay between private and public sectors and the compensation structures that shape the medical profession in the country. We won’t be covering insurance in-depth in this post (especially cheap health insurance). We’ll save that for another time.
-
-#### HK vs Singapore - a little on their healthcare systems
-
-Let's begin with comparing these two Asian countries before we double click into Singapore. The healthcare systems in Hong Kong and Singapore are often praised for their efficiency, accessibility, and quality of care. Comparing across a few criteria - 
-
-Healthcare Expenditure: In terms of healthcare expenditure, Hong Kong and Singapore differ significantly. According to the World Bank, Hong Kong's healthcare expenditure accounted for approximately 17.5% of its GDP in 2019, while Singapore's healthcare expenditure was around 4.8% of its GDP in the same year. This substantial disparity suggests that Hong Kong allocates a higher proportion of its resources to healthcare compared to Singapore.
-
-Infrastructure and Facilities: Both Hong Kong and Singapore boast well-developed healthcare infrastructures. Hong Kong features a mix of public and private hospitals, including several renowned medical centers and specialty hospitals. Singapore, on the other hand, is known for its excellent public healthcare system, with a network of public hospitals and polyclinics. Additionally, Singapore has actively promoted medical tourism, attracting patients from around the world to seek specialized treatments.
-
-Healthcare Outcomes: When examining healthcare outcomes, both Hong Kong and Singapore demonstrate commendable results. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Hong Kong's life expectancy at birth is approximately 84 years, while Singapore's stands at around 83 years. These figures indicate that residents of both regions enjoy relatively long and healthy lives.
-
-Patient Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction is a crucial aspect of healthcare delivery. In a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority in 2020, 76% of respondents expressed satisfaction with the quality of healthcare services provided. Similarly, a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in Singapore in the same year reported that 85% of patients were satisfied with the overall quality of care received. These high satisfaction rates reflect the emphasis placed on patient-centered care in both systems.
-
-Challenges and Opportunities: Despite the positive aspects, both healthcare systems face challenges. In Hong Kong, long waiting times for specialist appointments and limited resources are areas of concern. In Singapore, the rising cost of healthcare and an aging population present challenges to sustainability and affordability. However, these challenges also present opportunities for continuous improvement, innovation, and policy reforms in both regions.
-
-Overall, both systems are robust, advanced and managed well. If you’re deciding which country to live in, I wouldn’t use healthcare as a deciding factor. 
-
-#### Cost of healthcare
-
-The average cost of healthcare in Singapore can vary depending on factors such as the type of medical service needed, the healthcare facility, and whether an individual is a citizen, permanent resident, or foreigner. However, it's important to note that the healthcare system in Singapore operates on a mixed financing model, with government subsidies and insurance coverage helping to make healthcare more affordable for residents.
-
-For Singapore citizens and permanent residents, a significant portion of healthcare costs is covered by government subsidies and the mandatory national health insurance scheme known as MediShield Life. MediShield Life provides basic coverage for hospitalization and selected outpatient treatments.
-
-That being said, there may still be out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles, co-payments, and non-subsidized services. The specific costs can vary widely based on factors like the complexity of the medical procedure, the ward class chosen (e.g., public hospital A ward, B1 ward, etc.), and the specific healthcare provider.
-
-For foreigners or individuals without permanent residency in Singapore, the cost of healthcare can be higher (significantly). They are generally not eligible for government subsidies and may need to rely on private insurance or self-payment for medical expenses. Private healthcare providers in Singapore often have their own pricing structures, which can vary significantly. All that being said, expats are most likely covered by private insurance from the company, with most being top-class. My company’s insurance covers $500 USD worth of eyeglasses every year. You just can’t complain. Insurance for expats in Singapore if out of pocket is expensive, but we’ll save that for another time.

-
-#### Service providers
-
-Public Singapore hospitals form the backbone for most of the country. Whilst the wait for public hospitals is generally much longer, the quality of them is top notch in Singapore. These hospitals provide high-quality medical services to cater to the healthcare needs of both local residents and international patients. Here are some features of public hospitals in Singapore:
-+ High-quality medical services: Singapore's public hospitals have modern facilities and advanced medical technology to deliver excellent healthcare services. These hospitals have top-notch medical experts and nursing staff dedicated to the treatment and care of patients (comparable to private)
-+ Wide range of specialized healthcare: Singapore's public hospitals cover various specialized fields, including internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, cardiology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and more. Whether it's routine health check-ups or complex surgeries, these hospitals provide comprehensive specialized medical services.
-+ Medical technology and innovation: Singapore's public hospitals are committed to driving medical technology innovation and application. These hospitals adopt advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies, including medical imaging, surgical robotics, genetic testing, precision medicine, and more, to provide more accurate and effective healthcare.
-+ Medical research and education: Public hospitals in Singapore collaborate closely with academic and research institutions to advance medical research and education. These hospitals constantly strive to enhance the level of healthcare and service quality through scientific research and the exchange of medical knowledge.
-+ Comprehensive healthcare services: Singapore's public hospitals offer comprehensive healthcare services, including preventive care, health screenings, chronic disease management, and rehabilitation care. These hospitals are committed to maintaining people's overall health and provide various preventive measures and health promotion activities.
-
-In conclusion, public hospitals in Singapore provide top-quality medical services, advanced technology, and a wide range of specialized healthcare. They prioritize patient care and continuously contribute to medical research and education. These hospitals play a crucial role in ensuring the well-being and health of the population in Singapore.
-
-Here's a list of the popular public hospitals
- + Singapore General Hospital (SGH): SGH is the largest and oldest public hospital in Singapore. It offers a comprehensive range of medical services and specialties, including general medicine, surgery, cardiology, oncology, and more.
-+ National University Hospital (NUH): NUH is a tertiary hospital linked to the National University of Singapore. It provides specialized medical care in various areas, including cardiology, orthopedics, neurology, and pediatrics.
-+ Changi General Hospital (CGH): CGH is located in the eastern part of Singapore and offers a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, surgery, women's health, and geriatrics.
-+ Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH): KTPH is a community hospital with a focus on holistic healthcare and patient-centered services. It provides general medical and surgical services, as well as specialized care in areas such as psychiatry and rehabilitation.
-+ Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH): TTSH is a leading acute care general hospital in Singapore. It offers a comprehensive range of medical services, including infectious diseases, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology, and more.
-
-Others include Alexandra hospital, KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), national university hospital and woodlands hospital. When looking for a hospital, remember to see what’s your nearest hospital and the hospital visiting hours.
-
-#### What are polyclinics?
-Polyclinics in Singapore are primary healthcare facilities that provide a range of general medical services to the public. These clinics are operated by the National Healthcare Group (NHG) and SingHealth, two major healthcare clusters in Singapore. Polyclinics aim to offer accessible and affordable healthcare services to Singaporean residents.
-
-Here are some key features and services provided by polyclinics:
-+ General Medical Services: Polyclinics offer general outpatient services such as consultations, examinations, diagnosis, and treatment for common medical conditions. They are staffed by a team of general practitioners (GPs) who provide primary healthcare.
-+ Chronic Disease Management: Polyclinics play a vital role in managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and others. They provide regular monitoring, health education, and medication management to help patients manage their conditions effectively.
-+ Health Screening: Polyclinics offer health screening programs that cover various age groups and specific health concerns. These screenings help detect and prevent potential health problems at an early stage.
-+ Dental Services: Many polyclinics have dental clinics that provide basic dental services like check-ups, scaling, polishing, and extractions.
-+ Health Promotion and Education: Polyclinics conduct health promotion activities and provide education on preventive measures, healthy lifestyle practices, and disease management.
-+ Allied Health Services: Some polyclinics have allied health professionals such as dietitians, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists who offer specialized services to support patient care.
-
-Polyclinics in Singapore operate on an appointment-based system, although walk-in consultations may be available for urgent cases. The fees charged at polyclinics are subsidized for Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, making healthcare services more affordable. Patients can also use their national health insurance, MediSave, to pay for eligible services at polyclinics. Polyclinics serve as an essential component of Singapore's primary healthcare system, providing accessible and comprehensive care to the community.
-
-### On to private hospitals
-
-#### Why go private?
-
-There are several reasons why individuals might choose to go to private hospitals instead of public hospitals in Singapore. Here are some possible reasons:
-+ Shorter waiting times: Private hospitals generally have shorter waiting times for consultations, treatments, and surgeries compared to public hospitals. This can be appealing for individuals who prefer quicker access to medical services.
-+ More personalized care: Private hospitals often provide a more personalized and luxurious healthcare experience. They may offer amenities such as private rooms, personalized attention from medical staff, and a greater focus on patient comfort and convenience.
-+ Access to specific doctors or specialists: Private hospitals may have a wider selection of doctors and specialists who may be renowned in their respective fields. Patients who have specific preferences or seek specialized care from a particular doctor may opt for private hospitals to access their preferred healthcare providers.
-+ Comprehensive health screening packages: Private hospitals often offer comprehensive health screening packages that cater to individuals who prioritize preventive care and regular health check-ups. These packages may include a wide range of tests and examinations to assess overall health and detect potential health issues at an early stage.
-+ Greater flexibility and choice: Private hospitals provide individuals with more flexibility and choice in terms of appointment scheduling, treatment options, and hospital preferences. Patients may have more control over their healthcare decisions and the ability to tailor their treatment experience according to their preferences.
-+ Availability of alternative therapies: Private hospitals may offer a broader range of alternative therapies and complementary medicine options that are not typically available in public hospitals. This can attract individuals who prefer a more holistic approach to healthcare. We'll cover Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) another time, but that's also a huge industry in Singapore.
-
-#### Popular private hospitals
-Here are some notable private hospitals in Singapore:
-+ Mount Elizabeth Hospital: Mount Elizabeth Hospital is one of the largest private hospitals in Singapore. It has two branches, Mount Elizabeth Orchard and Mount Elizabeth Novena, and offers a comprehensive range of medical specialties and advanced treatment options. This is part of the Parkway Health Group.
-+ Gleneagles Hospital: Gleneagles Hospital is a renowned private hospital in Singapore known for its high-quality healthcare services. It provides specialized care in areas such as cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, and women's health. This is also part of the Parkway Health Group
-+ Raffles Hospital: Raffles Hospital is a leading private hospital that offers a wide range of medical services and specialties. It is known for its advanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities and provides personalized and holistic healthcare.
-+ Thomson Medical Centre: Thomson Medical Centre is a private hospital that specializes in women's and children's healthcare. It offers a comprehensive range of obstetrics, gynecology, and pediatric services.
-+ Parkway East Hospital: Parkway East Hospital is a private general acute care hospital located in the eastern part of Singapore. It provides a broad range of medical services, including surgery, internal medicine, and specialized outpatient care.
-
-My humnble opinion of what's best - I’ve spent a long time at Raffles and recently moved over to Gleneagles / Mount E. Whilst Raffles doctors are fantastic, I struggle with their nurses, booking systems that surprisingly don’t communicate much with each other and insurance expenses (despite having the best medical insurance policy in Singapore). P.S., their health checks all suck.
-
-#### Private versus public comparison
-
-Whilst these are just approximates, here are cost ranges for healthcare services in Singapore, comparing public and private sectors:
-
-<u> Consultation fees <u>
-+ Public healthcare: GP consultation fees range from SGD 20 to SGD 50.
-+ Private healthcare: GP consultation fees can range from SGD 50 to SGD 150 or more.
-
-<u> Hospitalization costs (per day) <u>
-
-Public healthcare:
-+ Class B2 ward (shared room): SGD 200 to SGD 400.
-+ Class B1 ward (semi-private room): SGD 500 to SGD 800.
-+ Class A ward (single room): SGD 800 to SGD 2,000 or more.
-
-Private healthcare: Hospitalization costs can range from SGD 1,000 to SGD 3,000 or more, depending on the ward type and hospital.
-+ Outpatient services and treatments:
-+ Public healthcare: Diagnostic tests and procedures may have subsidized rates, varying depending on the specific service.
-+ Private healthcare: Diagnostic tests and procedures in private clinics or specialist centers can range from SGD 100 to SGD 500 or more, depending on the test or procedure.
-
-Medications:
-+ Public healthcare: Medications in public hospitals are typically available at subsidized rates, with prices varying based on the specific medication.
-+ Private healthcare: Medication costs in private healthcare settings can vary significantly depending on the medication and the pharmacy. Branded or specialized medications may be more expensive.
-
-#### Singapore absolutely crushed the pandemic
-
-Singapore has been widely recognized for its effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government implemented a comprehensive and proactive approach to control the spread of the virus and protect public health. Here are some key measures and strategies employed by Singapore:
-+ Early Response and Preparedness: Singapore responded swiftly to the outbreak by establishing a multi-ministry task force and implementing a range of preventive measures even before the first local cases were reported. This included border controls, contact tracing, quarantine measures, and public communication campaigns.
-+ Robust Testing and Contact Tracing: Singapore implemented widespread testing to identify and isolate infected individuals. Contact tracing efforts were intensified through the use of technology, such as the + TraceTogether mobile app, which helped identify and notify close contacts of confirmed cases.
-+ Stringent Quarantine and Isolation Measures: Infected individuals and close contacts were required to undergo mandatory quarantine or isolation in dedicated facilities or at home. Strict enforcement and monitoring were in place to ensure compliance.
-+ Public Health Measures: Singapore implemented various public health measures such as mask-wearing, safe distancing, and regular hand hygiene. These measures were communicated to the public through extensive public education campaigns.
-+ Effective Healthcare System: Singapore's healthcare system, with its strong infrastructure and capacity, played a crucial role in managing the pandemic. The government worked closely with healthcare institutions to increase testing capabilities, hospital capacity, and ensure sufficient resources for patient care.
-+ Clear Communication and Public Engagement: Regular updates and clear communication from government authorities helped to keep the public informed and educated about the evolving situation. Public engagement and adherence to guidelines were emphasized to foster a collective responsibility in managing the pandemic.
-
-#### Given the healthcare system is so robust, how much are doctors being paid?
-
-You'll be surprised with this one.
-
-1st year doctor pay in USD
-+ SG: $3400
-+ HK: $10K
-+ US: $5400
-
-Median gross monthly salary for Singapore fresh graduates is $3.1K USD. (source - Strait times). It baffles me how little these first year doctors earn. For context, a fresh non-tech grad at Google in the US earns $8000 working 40 hours a week. Singapore first year doctors work at least 60% more hours. 
-
-I personally know 1st year doctors who were thrown into COVID wards, and whilst there was overall fear, the resounding message was the government is in control. All that being said, they were awarded with medals (versus any sort of monetary reward) for their service. I understand doctors are here to serve the public but it’d be nice for them to be compensated. 
-
-#### No wonder there's a shortage on doctors...
-
-What’s interesting now is that there’s a shortage of doctors. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Singapore has been experiencing a relative shortage of doctors in certain specialties and settings. While Singapore has a well-established healthcare system and a sufficient number of doctors overall, there are specific areas that face challenges in terms of doctor availability.
-
-One area of concern is the demand for specialized medical professionals, such as oncologists, cardiologists, and psychiatrists, which has been growing due to an aging population and increased healthcare needs. Additionally, some rural or remote areas in Singapore may have difficulty attracting doctors, leading to a disparity in healthcare access.
-
-To address this, the Singaporean government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of doctors. These efforts include expanding medical education capacity, attracting foreign doctors, and offering scholarships and incentives to encourage medical students to specialize in needed fields.
-It's important to note that the situation may have evolved since my last update, and it's recommended to refer to recent reports and studies for the most accurate and up-to-date information on the current doctor shortage in Singapore. Please increase pay for public doctors.
-
-The healthcare system in Singapore is undeniably a privilege. With its efficient, high-quality, and accessible healthcare services, supported by well-funded public hospitals, advanced medical technology, and government subsidies, Singaporeans are fortunate to have comprehensive healthcare coverage that is the envy of many nations. The ability to receive top-notch medical care without significant financial burden truly makes Singapore's healthcare system a valuable privilege for its expats and citizens.

-Welcome to my blog, From HK to SG (FHK2SG), your go-to guide for expat living in Singapore.
+Welcome to my blog, From HK to SG (FHK2SG), your go-to guide for expat living in Singapore. 你好
 
 I was born and raised in Hong Kong and spent 18 golden years growing up there. After a short stint in the States for college and work, I moved to Singapore to pursue a new career opportunity at a big tech company and have since settled into the country for the past 5 years.
