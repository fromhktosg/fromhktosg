<p>Originally from London, Jellycat has taken the world by storm, proving that stuffed toys aren’t just for kids. Adults, too, have fallen for these cuddly companions, whether for stress relief, aesthetic appeal, or just an excuse to collect yet another plushie. From classic Bashful Bunnies to the latest Amuseable Avocado, there’s always a new Jellycat to obsess over. If you’re wondering where to buy Jellycats in Singapore—or even looking for budget-friendly alternatives—we’ve got you covered.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-jellycats">What are jellycats?</h3>

<p>Jellycats are premium plush toys known for their unbelievably soft texture, quirky designs, and high-quality craftsmanship. They come in a variety of shapes and characters, from adorable animals to playful food items, making them a favorite among collectors of all ages. Unlike generic stuffed toys, Jellycats have a distinct charm—whether it’s their floppy limbs, endearing expressions, or the sheer huggability that makes them hard to put down. They’ve gained a cult following not just for their cuteness but also for their luxurious feel, often described as “the softest plush you’ll ever touch.” Whether you’re looking for a comforting bedtime companion or just another plushie to add to your growing collection, Jellycats have a way of sneaking into your heart (and onto your shelves).</p>

<h3 id="origin-of-jellycats">Origin of jellycats</h3>

<p>Jellycat was founded in London in 1999 by brothers Thomas and William Gatacre, who wanted to create plush toys that were both irresistibly soft and uniquely quirky. The brand’s unusual name came from a child’s playful mashup of two favorite things—jelly and cats—setting the tone for the whimsical and imaginative designs that followed. From the beginning, the Gatacre brothers focused on quality and creativity, crafting plushies that felt luxurious and looked delightfully different from typical stuffed toys. Their early designs featured playful textures, floppy limbs, and unexpected characters, breaking away from the traditional teddy bear mold. As demand grew, Jellycat expanded its lineup with more charming and eccentric plushies, turning a small passion project into a global phenomenon loved by collectors of all ages.</p>

<p>While tacos, burritos, and nachos are everywhere, true authentic Mexican food in Singapore is much more than just Tex-Mex flavors and a side of guacamole. From rich, slow-cooked mole to fresh ceviche and handmade tortillas, iconic Mexican food dishes are complex, vibrant, and—unfortunately—not always easy to track down here. But don’t worry, whether you’re hunting for the best Mexican restaurants in Singapore, searching for Mexican food near me, or craving Mexican food delivery in Singapore, there are options if you know where to look. So, is Singapore finally getting the Mexican food scene it deserves? Still far from it but getting there.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-authentic-mexican-food">What is authentic Mexican food?</h3>

<p>Authentic Mexican food is a rich and diverse cuisine rooted in indigenous Mesoamerican traditions, later influenced by Spanish colonization. It features bold flavors, fresh ingredients, and traditional cooking techniques like slow-roasting, stone-grinding, and hand-pressing tortillas. Staples include corn, beans, chili peppers, and herbs like cilantro and epazote, with iconic dishes such as tacos al pastor, mole poblano, tamales, and chiles en nogada. Unlike Tex-Mex, which leans heavily on cheddar cheese, sour cream, and flour tortillas, authentic Mexican food prioritizes fresh salsas, handmade tortillas, and balanced spice. True Mexican cuisine is about vibrant, complex flavors that showcase regional diversity, from the seafood-rich dishes of Baja California to the barbacoa traditions of central Mexico. Singapore mexican food is a lot closer to Tex-Mex but there’s a spectrum of authenticity. We’ll get there.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-authentic-mexican-food-in-singapore">Why is it so hard to find authentic Mexican food in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Authentic Mexican food is hard to find in Singapore because it’s just not that popular—yet. Unlike Japanese or Korean cuisine, which have massive followings, Mexican food hasn’t quite hit the mainstream here. Many restaurants lean toward Tex-Mex, serving cheese-heavy burritos and hard-shell tacos instead of true Mexican flavors. Another challenge is the price range—authentic Mexican food should be available from cheap street-style tacos to high-end dining, but in Singapore, it’s often skewed toward the pricier side due to imported ingredients and niche demand. Plus, with relatively few South American people here to make / order the food, finding truly authentic Mexican food in Singapore is even trickier.</p>

More often than your Grab driver during surge pricing, and usually on time—unless there’s a track fault.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for the latest Singapore MRT schedule, wondering about the Singapore MRT fare, or debating between the Singapore MRT vs bus, we’ve got you covered. We’ll also take a quick ride through Singapore MRT history, introduce you to every Singapore MRT line, highlight key stations, and even look at upcoming Singapore MRT lines. And if you’re curious about Singapore MRT payment methods, yes, you can tap in with your credit card or Apple Watch—because carrying a separate transit card is so last decade. Let’s dive in and make your Singapore train commute as smooth as possible.</p>

<h3 id="when-does-the-singapore-mrt-start-and-end">When does the Singapore MRT start and end?</h3>

<p>The Singapore MRT generally starts running around 5:30 AM and operates until about midnight. On Fridays, Saturdays, and the eve of public holidays, some lines may run slightly later, usually until 12:30 AM. First and last train times vary by station and MRT line, so it’s always a good idea to check the TransitLink SimplyGo app or the official SMRT/LTA website for exact timings. If you miss the last train, your options are limited to night buses, Grab, or paying the price for a late-night taxi ride.</p>

<h3 id="how-often-does-the-singapore-mrt-arrive">How often does the Singapore MRT arrive?</h3>

<p>The Singapore MRT typically arrives every 2 to 5 minutes during peak hours and 5 to 7 minutes during off-peak hours. Late at night or early in the morning, trains may run every 10 to 15 minutes. On weekends and public holidays, frequencies can vary slightly depending on the line and time of day. If you’re traveling on less busy lines like the Thomson-East Coast Line, expect slightly longer wait times.</p>

<p>The Singapore MRT was officially constructed in 1983, with the first line, the North-South Line (NSL), opening in 1987. This marked the beginning of Singapore’s ambitious plan to create a world-class public transport system. The project was designed to reduce road congestion and provide an efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly mode of transportation for the growing city-state. Since then, the MRT network has expanded significantly, with new lines and extensions making it one of the most advanced urban rail systems in the world.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-take-the-mrt-on-the-bus">Should I take the MRT on the bus?</h3>

<p>The question of whether you should take the MRT or the bus really depends on a few things: where you’re going, how much time you have, and whether you’re in the mood for an adventure. If you’re heading somewhere on the MRT, it’s usually the faster, more reliable option—especially during peak hours, when buses might get stuck in traffic. The MRT is direct, air-conditioned, and mostly on time, offering quicker connections to key spots across the city. On the other hand, if you’re in no rush and prefer scenic views or if you’re traveling somewhere without an MRT station nearby, the bus could be your better choice. Just keep in mind that buses can be a little more unpredictable, but hey, they come with a more personal touch—like making new friends during rush hour.</p>

<p>We wrote about coffee in a previous <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-coffee-starbucks/">article</a>. What about Kopi? It’s that sweet, strong traditional Singaporean coffee that you’ve probably encountered at every <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/hk-versus-sg-food/">hawker centre</a>, often served with a side of Singaporean charm (or maybe a long wait). But before you make any assumptions, let’s clear up the difference between Kopi vs Western coffee and break down the many ways of ordering Kopi in Singapore—because ordering it wrong could definitely get you some raised eyebrows. Need a guide to Singapore’s kopi terminology or want to settle the Kopi C vs Kopi O debate once and for all? We’ve got you covered. Whether you’re wondering what goes well with Kopi (hint: a classic Kopi and kaya toast pairing never fails) or just looking for the best Kopi spots in Singapore, this is your ultimate guide. And for those days when you’re feeling less coffee and more tea—well, don’t worry, there’s a solution for that too.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-kopi">What is Kopi?</h3>

<p>The word kopi comes from the Malay and Indonesian languages, which both borrowed it from the Dutch word koffie, meaning coffee. This reflects the colonial influence in Southeast Asia, where coffee cultivation and trade flourished under European powers. In Singapore, kopi has evolved into its own distinct style, referring specifically to the strong, bold coffee brewed with robusta beans and typically sweetened with condensed or evaporated milk. Unlike Western-style coffee, Singapore’s kopi is made using a sock-like cloth filter and brewed in metal pots, giving it a rich, smooth taste that locals swear by.</p>

<h3 id="kopi-vs-coffee">Kopi vs coffee</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Kopi – Traditional Singaporean coffee made with robusta beans, brewed using a cloth filter, and often mixed with condensed or evaporated milk for a rich, sweet flavor.</li>
  <li>Coffee – Typically refers to Western-style coffee, brewed with arabica or robusta beans using espresso machines, drip coffee makers, or French presses, with a more varied range of flavors and textures.</li>

<p>From the classic instant noodles to the more exotic instant ramen varieties, these pre-packaged wonders cater to every palate. But why do people eat instant ramen? Is it unhealthy to eat instant ramen? We’ll unpack all of this today when we discuss the best instant ramen in Singapore.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-instant-ramen">What is instant ramen?</h3>

<p>Instant ramen is a type of pre-cooked noodle dish that comes with a seasoning packet or sauce, making it incredibly easy and quick to prepare. Invented in Japan in the 1950s, instant ramen has since become a global food phenomenon due to its convenience, affordability, and long shelf life. It typically consists of wheat noodles, dried vegetables, and a flavoring mix—though some premium varieties include broth bases and various seasonings. Whether you’re craving a quick snack or an emergency meal, instant ramen is the go-to solution for many around the world, especially when time is tight or cooking feels like too much effort.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-instant-ramen">Types of instant ramen</h3>

<p>There are several types of instant ramen, each offering a unique twist on the classic dish. The most common type is soup ramen, where the noodles come with a liquid broth or seasoning powder that creates a soupy base. Then, there’s dry ramen, where the noodles are drained and tossed with a savory sauce or seasoning mix for a more stir-fried or saucy experience. For those who enjoy a little indulgence, cheesy ramen has been gaining popularity, with cheese added either as a powder or melted on top to create a creamy, rich texture. Different nationalities have their own take on instant ramen, too—Japanese ramen often comes in miso, shoyu, and shio flavors, while Korean instant ramen might feature spicy kimchi broth or a hearty beef stew base. Even Singapore has its own version, with unique local flavors like laksa and curry-based instant ramen that cater to local tastes and spice levels.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-people-eat-instant-ramen">Why do people eat instant ramen?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Convenience – It’s quick and easy to prepare, making it the perfect meal for busy days or late-night cravings.</li>
  <li>Affordability – Instant ramen is inexpensive, offering a budget-friendly meal option.</li>
  <li>Comfort – It’s a familiar, comforting dish that many people associate with home, nostalgia, or a quick fix.</li>
  <li>Versatility – You can customize it with different toppings like eggs, vegetables, or meats to suit your taste.</li>
  <li>Long Shelf Life – Instant ramen has a long expiration date, making it a pantry staple that’s always available in case of emergencies.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="is-it-unhealthy-to-eat-instant-ramen">Is it unhealthy to eat instant ramen?</h3>

<p>Instant ramen is often considered unhealthy due to its high sodium content, artificial additives, and low nutritional value. A typical serving can contain over 1,000 milligrams of sodium, which is about half of the recommended daily intake. Additionally, many instant ramen varieties are fried before packaging, leading to higher fat content. While it’s not the most nutritious meal option, occasional consumption in moderation is generally safe for most people. To make it healthier, consider adding fresh vegetables, lean proteins, or using less seasoning to reduce sodium levels. In Singapore, instant ramen remains a popular go-to, despite health concerns, because of its convenience and affordability.</p>

<h3 id="what-toppings-do-you-add-to-instant-ramen">What toppings do you add to instant ramen?</h3>

<p>When it comes to enhancing your instant ramen, the toppings are endless. Here are some popular choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Egg – A soft-boiled or poached egg adds richness and protein to your ramen.</li>
  <li>Hotpot Meat – Thinly sliced beef, pork, or even chicken can be added for a heartier meal, with hotpot-style meats commonly available in Singapore’s markets.</li>
  <li>Scallions – Freshly chopped scallions bring a sharp, flavorful crunch to your bowl.</li>
  <li>Tofu – Soft or fried tofu adds a smooth, protein-packed element, commonly found in Singaporean variations like laksa ramen.</li>
  <li>Cheese – For a creamy, indulgent twist, cheese (especially processed or mozzarella) is becoming a popular topping in instant ramen recipes.</li>
  <li>Dumplings – Mini dumplings, often filled with pork or vegetables, can elevate your ramen with extra flavor and texture.</li>
  <li>Vegetables – Greens like spinach, bok choy, or mushrooms add freshness and nutrients to your ramen, aligning with the preference for balance in Singapore’s food culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>These toppings not only boost the flavor but can also help make your instant ramen a more complete, satisfying meal.</p>

<p>The usual process of an ice bath typically follows these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare the Water: Fill a bathtub, plunge pool, or container with cold water, adding ice to lower the temperature to around 10-15°C (50-59°F).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set a Timer: It’s recommended to stay in the ice bath for about 10-15 minutes to avoid extreme cold exposure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter Slowly: Ease into the cold water gradually to allow your body to adjust to the shock of the temperature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submerge Your Body: Ideally, the water should cover most of your body, up to your neck for maximum benefits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Focus on Breathing: Maintain deep, controlled breathing to help manage the discomfort and focus on relaxation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exit Carefully: Once your time is up, slowly exit the bath to allow your body to warm up naturally, often by doing gentle movements or a warm shower.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Warm back up: Chant “hoo ha, hoo ha” while bending your knees and pushing your arms in opposite directions to help activate your body and warm up. It might sound odd, but it can aid in bringing back warmth and energy! Wim hof technique.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always listen to your body and avoid staying in too long, as overexposure can lead to hypothermia or other risks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-do-i-decide-on-the-temperature-of-the-ice-bath">How do I decide on the temperature of the ice bath?</h3>

<p>Deciding on the temperature of your ice bath depends on your goals, tolerance, and experience level. Here’s a quick guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For Beginners: Start with a warmer ice bath around 15°C (59°F). This will still provide some benefits without shocking your system too much. Gradually decrease the temperature as your body adjusts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Muscle Recovery: The ideal temperature for muscle recovery is typically between 10-15°C (50-59°F). This range helps reduce muscle inflammation and soreness effectively without causing too much discomfort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Advanced Users: If you’ve been practicing ice baths for a while, you can aim for a colder bath around 5-10°C (41-50°F) to intensify the recovery process. However, this can be challenging, so always listen to your body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Mental Toughness: If you’re aiming to improve mental resilience, colder temperatures might be more beneficial, but it’s crucial to stay mindful of how your body is reacting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal Tolerance: The best temperature ultimately depends on how your body responds. If you start feeling numb or excessively uncomfortable, it’s a sign to warm up or exit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start slow and adjust based on what feels right for you to avoid any risks of overexposure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-the-risks-of-doing-an-ice-bath">What are the risks of doing an ice bath?</h3>

<p>While ice baths offer benefits like muscle recovery and reduced inflammation, they also come with some risks, especially if done improperly or for too long. Here are the main risks to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hypothermia: Staying in an ice bath for too long can lower your body temperature to dangerous levels, leading to hypothermia. Symptoms include shivering, confusion, and fatigue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frostbite: Prolonged exposure to extreme cold can cause tissue damage, leading to frostbite, particularly in extremities like fingers, toes, and ears.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shock to the System: The sudden cold can cause an abrupt shock to your body, potentially increasing your heart rate and blood pressure, which could be dangerous for those with heart conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numbness and Tingling: Ice baths can cause temporary numbness or tingling sensations, which can lead to discomfort or even injury if you’re not careful when exiting the bath.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Impaired Circulation: If you don’t warm up properly after an ice bath, it can disrupt blood flow and leave you feeling lightheaded or weak.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Risk for Pre-existing Conditions: People with certain conditions like Raynaud’s disease (poor circulation in fingers and toes), heart disease, or respiratory issues should avoid ice baths or consult a doctor before trying them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s crucial to monitor your time in the bath and ensure you’re in good health before engaging in this practice. Always warm up gradually afterward to avoid additional risks. If you’re a beginner, it’s best to have someone watch over you to ensure your safety.</p>

<p>Given the humid weather, air-conditioned offices, and occasional haze, you’d think we’d have mastered the art of inhaling and exhaling by now. But breathwork—yes, that’s a thing—goes beyond just surviving the MRT rush hour. Unlike meditation, which focuses on mindfulness, breathwork actively trains your lungs to work smarter, not harder. If ice baths aren’t your thing but you’re still looking for a way to boost energy and reduce stress, maybe it’s time to try controlling your breath instead. From relaxation to better focus, breathing might just be the wellness hack you didn’t know you needed—so let’s take a deep breath and explore.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-the-breath-so-important">Why is the breath so important?</h3>

<p>Breathing isn’t just about staying alive—it’s the key to better energy, mental clarity, and overall health. Science shows that deep diaphragmatic breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing cortisol levels and lowering stress. On the flip side, shallow chest breathing—something many Singaporeans do unconsciously due to long hours at desks and high humidity—can trigger the body’s fight-or-flight response, increasing anxiety and fatigue. Proper breathwork improves oxygen exchange, enhances lung capacity, and even boosts athletic endurance by increasing CO2 tolerance. If you’re looking for an easy, science-backed way to feel better, optimizing your breath might be the best biohack yet.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-breathwork">What is breathwork?</h3>

<p>Breathwork is the practice of consciously controlling your breathing to improve physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Unlike the automatic, shallow breaths we take throughout the day, breathwork techniques focus on deep, intentional inhales and exhales to regulate the nervous system.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-breathwork-different-from-meditation">How is breathwork different from meditation?</h3>

<p>Breathwork involves actively controlling your breath to regulate the nervous system and achieve specific physical or mental benefits, while meditation focuses on quieting the mind and cultivating mindfulness. Essentially, breathwork is a dynamic practice, whereas meditation is more about stillness and mental presence.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-breathwork">What are the benefits of breathwork?</h3>

<p><u>Benefits of Breathwork<u></u></u></p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduces Stress and Anxiety: Breathwork activates the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering cortisol levels and promoting relaxation (backed by Western science on stress reduction).</li>
  <li>Improves Mental Clarity and Focus: Techniques like box breathing enhance concentration and cognitive performance by increasing oxygen flow to the brain.</li>
  <li>Boosts Energy and Endurance: The Wim Hof Method, for example, combines deep breathing with cold exposure to increase energy levels and physical endurance.</li>
  <li>Enhances Emotional Regulation: Breathwork helps release pent-up emotions and balance mood, contributing to better emotional health (supported by both Western psychology and Eastern practices like yoga).</li>
  <li>Improves Sleep Quality: Controlled breathing reduces overactive thinking, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.</li>
  <li>Supports Immune Function: Breathwork can strengthen the immune system, with studies showing improved immune response through deep breathing techniques (Western and Asian wellness traditions support this).</li>
  <li>Promotes Better Respiratory Health: Deep breathing increases lung capacity and oxygenation, improving overall respiratory function, particularly in practices like pranayama in yoga.</li>
  <li>Helps in Pain Management: Breathwork can reduce the perception of pain by releasing endorphins, providing relief from chronic pain or discomfort.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-breathing-exercises-are-there">What breathing exercises are there?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing): Focuses on deep belly breaths to engage the diaphragm and promote relaxation.</li>
  <li>Box Breathing: Involves inhaling, holding, exhaling, and holding for equal counts (e.g., 4 seconds each), commonly used for stress reduction and focus.</li>
  <li>Wim Hof Method: Combines deep, controlled hyperventilation with cold exposure to increase oxygen levels and enhance endurance.</li>
  <li>4-7-8 Breathing: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds to help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.</li>
  <li>Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana): Involves inhaling and exhaling through one nostril at a time, used to balance the body’s energy and calm the mind (popular in yoga).</li>
</ul>

<p>Its a personal preference or which one to practice. I’m a big fan of the Wim Hof method and box breathing. A lot of these resources can be found on YouTube where you can practice for 20-30 minutes a day.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-you-practice-breathwork">When should you practice breathwork?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Morning: Start your day with a session of diaphragmatic breathing or the Wim Hof Method to boost energy, focus, and mental clarity.</li>
  <li>During Stressful Moments: Use box breathing or 4-7-8 breathing when you’re feeling overwhelmed to calm your mind and regulate your emotions.</li>
  <li>Before Sleep: Practice 4-7-8 breathing or diaphragmatic breathing to relax your body and improve sleep quality.</li>
  <li>Throughout the Day: Integrate simple breathwork whenever you need a mental reset or emotional balance.</li>
</ul>

<p>A deep breath before you make decisions or if you are feeling reactive goes a long wayt!</p>

<p>The best time for breathwork is when you need it most—whether for relaxation, focus, energy, or emotional regulation, and practicing with a partner or having someone hold you accountable can make it easier to stick to your routine.</p>

<h3 id="books-about-better-breathing">Books about better breathing</h3>

<p>A few books on better breathing that provide in-depth knowledge and practical techniques:</p>

  <li>“The Oxygen Advantage” by Patrick McKeown: Focuses on breathing exercises that improve athletic performance, reduce stress, and boost overall health through nasal breathing and breath control.</li>
