In Singapore, it’s all the rage, with people swearing by their stylish yet functional gear, making you wonder if it’s more about their performance or the ability to wear a brand that screams “I’m an explorer” while sipping a flat white. From their iconic jackets to those ‘essential’ pants, there’s no denying the appeal, though the hefty price tag might have you questioning whether it’s worth the investment for your next nature hike or Instagram post. But don’t worry, I’ll break down why Arcteryx has earned its lofty reputation (and cost), and more importantly, where you can snag it for a price that won’t require you to sell a kidney. And for those not ready to commit to this outdoor fashion empire, stick around for some alternatives that might just let you look the part without the wallet shock.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-arcteryx">What is Arc’teryx?</h3>

<p>Arcteryx is a Canadian outdoor clothing and equipment company founded in 1989, known for its high-performance gear built to withstand extreme conditions. The brand’s name is inspired by Archaeopteryx, a prehistoric bird that symbolizes the evolution of flight, aligning with Arcteryx’s ethos of pushing boundaries in both design and function. The company initially made a name for itself by focusing on technical outerwear, creating products designed for climbers, skiers, and other extreme athletes who needed durable and reliable gear. Their commitment to quality and innovation quickly earned them a loyal following within outdoor sports communities, where the brand became synonymous with premium outdoor wear.</p>

<p>By the mid-2000s, Arcteryx expanded its reach globally, making a significant impact in fashion-conscious urban environments as well. In Singapore, the brand began to gain traction around the early 2010s, as a growing number of locals started to embrace not only outdoor activities but also the ‘activewear’ trend that blends fashion with function. With its sleek designs and the promise of high-performance technology, Arcteryx found its place in the hearts of both serious adventurers and those who just wanted to look like they were ready for a trek up Mount Everest, despite the sweltering Singaporean heat.</p>

Whether you’re a fan of the thin, crisp New York-style slice or the soft, pillowy crust of Neapolitan pizza, there’s no shortage of options. But what exactly makes a good Neapolitan pizza? Is it the perfect char on the crust, the right balance of toppings, or just sheer pizza magic? In this article, we’ll dive into the different types of Neapolitan pizzas, explore what defines a truly exceptional slice, and share where to get the best pizzas in Singapore (yes, even if you think pizza’s just a delivery convenience).

<h3 id="why-are-so-many-pizza-stores-opening-up-in-singapore-lately">Why are so many pizza stores opening up in Singapore lately?</h3>

<p>Well, it seems that Singapore’s love affair with pizza is reaching new heights, and it’s hard to blame them when the city has become a hub for all things trendy—and yes, pizza fits right in. With an increasing demand for more authentic, diverse, and Instagram-worthy food options, pizza shops are capitalizing on our collective desire for quality (and photogenic) pies. Add in the influence of global food trends, where Neapolitan and New York-style pizzas have taken over social media feeds, and you’ve got a recipe for more pizza than we can shake a slice at. Combine that with Singapore’s obsession with dining out and trying the latest culinary trends, and it’s no surprise that pizza joints are popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. Let’s face it: in a food-obsessed city like this, pizza is the perfect dish to keep us coming back for more.</p>

<p>Types of pizza stores</p>

<p>Neapolitan Pizza – Authentic, thin-crust pizzas with simple, high-quality ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella di bufala. Expect a wood-fired oven and a touch of char.
New York-Style Pizza – Large, foldable slices with a thin, crispy crust, typically served with a variety of classic toppings and sometimes a hefty amount of grease (yum).
Roman-Style Pizza – Known for its crispy, cracker-like thin crust and square shape. This one’s all about precision in the bake.
Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza – If you’re into pizza that doubles as a casserole, this is your slice. Thick, buttery crust and layers of gooey cheese and sauce—essentially, pizza lasagna.
Sicilian Pizza – Square or rectangular slices with a thick, fluffy crust and toppings that are often piled on a little more generously than other styles.
Artisanal Pizza – These pizza places are all about experimentation with unique toppings, gourmet ingredients, and sometimes unconventional crusts, making every pizza an art piece.
Japanese/Korean Fusion Pizza – Think teriyaki chicken, kimchi, or even raw salmon on your pizza, with crusts ranging from thin to chewy, giving you an adventurous take on pizza that’s a little more umami than usual.</p>

<p>In my eyes, nothing is better than a good neapolitan pizza. Let’s break it down.</p>

<p>What makes a good neapolitan pizza</p>

<p>A truly exceptional Neapolitan pizza is about much more than just tossing toppings onto dough—it’s about the perfect balance of ingredients, technique, and tradition. Here’s what makes a good Neapolitan pizza:
The Dough – It all starts with the dough. Neapolitan pizza dough should be made with just four ingredients: flour, water, salt, and yeast. The dough needs to be soft, slightly chewy, and elastic, with a thin center and a slightly thicker crust that puffs up beautifully during baking.
The Crust – A good Neapolitan pizza has a puffy, airy crust with a bit of char, thanks to the high heat of a wood-fired oven. The crust should be thin but not flimsy, with a perfect balance between crispness and chewiness.
San Marzano Tomatoes – The sauce should be made from high-quality San Marzano tomatoes, which are sweet, low-acid, and perfect for pizza sauce. The tomatoes are typically crushed and used without additional seasoning, letting their natural flavor shine.
Mozzarella di Bufala – The cheese should be fresh mozzarella, and ideally, mozzarella di bufala (buffalo milk mozzarella) for that creamy, slightly tangy flavor. It should melt beautifully and not be overly greasy.
Fresh Basil – A few fresh basil leaves scattered across the pizza after it comes out of the oven adds aromatic freshness and a slight peppery kick, complementing the rich tomato sauce and cheese.
Olive Oil – A drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil before or after baking enhances the flavors and adds a rich, smooth finish to the pizza.
Wood-Fired Oven – A traditional Neapolitan pizza is baked in a wood-fired oven at around 800-900°F (430-480°C). The high heat cooks the pizza in just 90 seconds, resulting in a crisp crust with slightly charred spots and a melty, bubbly center.
Proper Balance of Toppings – The toppings should never overwhelm the crust. Neapolitan pizza is all about simplicity—too many toppings would ruin the delicate balance. The classic Margherita, with its tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, is the gold standard.
Texture – The pizza should have a soft, pliable center that you can fold easily. When you bite into it, it should have a delicate crunch on the outer crust, with the center being tender but not soggy.
No Overloading on Cheese – While cheese is essential, a Neapolitan pizza should never have too much. The cheese should melt evenly across the pizza, without pooling into greasy puddles. It’s about balance, not excess.
Simplicity of Flavors – The beauty of Neapolitan pizza is its simplicity. Each ingredient should be allowed to shine, with no one flavor overpowering the others. The sauce, cheese, and basil should come together in a harmonious balance.
Tradition – A true Neapolitan pizza should follow the regulations of the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN), which ensures authenticity in both the ingredients and the preparation. It’s the commitment to traditional methods that makes a good Neapolitan pizza stand out.
Serving Style – Neapolitan pizza is typically served as a whole pie, and it’s meant to be eaten immediately while it’s fresh out of the oven, so the crust remains crisp but not hard.
Temperature – It should be served piping hot but not burning, with the cheese perfectly melted and the crust still crisp and slightly smoky from the wood-fired oven.
Minimal Toppings – While variations exist, Neapolitan pizza is known for keeping it simple. The more classic Margherita or Marinara usually have just a few toppings—no crazy add-ins or unnecessary garnishes.
Cultural Authenticity – A true Neapolitan pizza doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. It stays true to its Italian heritage, with a focus on the purity and simplicity of its ingredients, and the mastery of traditional cooking methods.
When done right, a Neapolitan pizza is a thing of beauty—simple, delicious, and packed with flavor, proving that sometimes, less is more.
What types of neapolitan pizza are there?</p>

<p>Margherita – The classic Neapolitan pizza, topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil.
Marinara – A simple yet flavorful pizza with tomato sauce, garlic, oregano, and olive oil. No cheese, just pure, bold tomato goodness.
Diavola – A spicy pizza featuring tomato sauce, mozzarella, and spicy salami (often pepperoni or a similar cured meat) for that fiery kick.
Quattro Formaggi – A cheesy delight with a mix of four cheeses, typically mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmesan, and ricotta, creating a rich, creamy flavor.
Capricciosa – A pizza loaded with a variety of toppings such as tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, artichokes, olives, and ham.
Prosciutto e Funghi – A combination of prosciutto (Italian ham) and mushrooms on top of tomato sauce and mozzarella for a savory, earthy flavor.
Napoli – Featuring tomatoes, mozzarella, anchovies, capers, and olives, this one’s for fans of salty, umami-packed toppings.
Boscaiola – A rustic pizza made with mushrooms, sausage, and sometimes a touch of cream, offering a comforting, hearty flavor.
Frutti di Mare – A seafood pizza that includes a variety of fresh seafood like shrimp, clams, and mussels, often topped with a sprinkle of parsley

<p>How much you should expect to pay for a good pizza in singapore
Expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $40+ for a good pizza in Singapore, depending on the style, restaurant, and toppings.
Casual pizza spots (e.g., Extra Virgin Pizza, Anto Pizza) – $25 to $30 for a standard pizza.
High-end Italian restaurants (e.g., Osteria Mozza, L’Antica Pizzeria Da Michele) – $30 to $40+ for a gourmet Neapolitan pizza.
Fancy toppings (truffle, burrata, premium meats) – Add $5 to $15 per topping.
Personal-sized pizzas (e.g., Wild Child Pizzette) – $25 to $28, though you might need two to feel full.
Wood-fired or artisan pizzas – Typically in the $28 to $38 range.
If you’re after an authentic Neapolitan pizza, expect to spend around $28 to $35, while a decent New York-style slice (if you can find one) is usually only sold as whole pies for $25 to $35. Cheap pizza exists, but if you want quality dough, good ingredients, and proper cooking techniques, $25 is your starting point—anything below that is probably just bread with sauce.

Unlike their Western counterparts, these bakeries favor buttery crusts, dense flavors, and just the right amount of sweetness—because who needs frosting when you have perfectly caramelized pastry? From wife cakes (老婆饼) to char siu buns (叉烧包), the sheer variety is enough to make you rethink your usual morning toast. But not all Chinese bakeries are created equal—some master the art of crisp, golden crusts and silky custards, while others leave you wondering if they accidentally swapped sugar for salt. In Singapore, you don’t have to look far for legendary egg tarts, nostalgic old-school cakes, and buns so soft they defy physics—but choosing the right bakery? That’s where things get interesting.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-chinese-bakeries">What are Chinese bakeries?</h3>

<p>Chinese bakeries are where tradition meets indulgence, offering a mix of soft, fluffy breads, delicate pastries, and crispy, flaky delights. Unlike Western bakeries that focus on buttery richness or Japanese bakeries that perfect airy textures, Chinese bakeries excel at variety—you’ll find everything from sweet red bean buns to savory pork floss rolls and golden egg tarts.
These bakeries often feature Hong Kong-style, Taiwanese, and even Cantonese influences, meaning you’ll see pineapple buns (bo lo bao), century egg pastries, and custard-filled delights alongside more modern takes like matcha swiss rolls or coffee-flavored buns. And, of course, no Chinese bakery is complete without the iconic mooncakes that make a grand appearance every Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

<p>Another key feature? Affordability and accessibility. Unlike high-end patisseries, Chinese bakeries are often found in heartland neighborhoods and shopping malls, offering fresh, warm pastries that are delicious, filling, and easy on the wallet.
Whether you’re grabbing a quick breakfast, an afternoon snack, or a nostalgic taste of home, Chinese bakeries deliver the perfect mix of sweet, savory, and everything in between—all wrapped up in a paper bag with a plastic tray and tongs.</p>

<h3 id="pastries-that-chinese-bakeries-sell">Pastries that Chinese bakeries sell?</h3>

<p>Chinese bakeries are known for their wide variety of sweet and savory pastries, each with its own unique texture and flavor.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of must-try items:</p>

<p><u>Sweet Pastries<u></u></u></p>

<ul>
  <li>Egg Tart (蛋挞) – A buttery, flaky crust filled with smooth, sweet egg custard. The Hong Kong-style ones are extra glossy.</li>

  <li>Wife Cake (老婆饼, Lao Po Bing) – A thin, flaky pastry filled with winter melon paste—lightly sweet and chewy inside.</li>
  <li>Red Bean Bun (豆沙包, Dou Sha Bao) – Soft bread with a mildly sweet red bean paste filling, a classic favorite.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-chinese-bakery-good">What makes a Chinese bakery good?</h3>

<p>A good Chinese bakery isn’t just about selling bread—it’s about nailing the balance between tradition, texture, and flavor. Here’s what separates the great ones from the forgettable ones:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Perfectly Soft &amp; Fluffy Bread
Chinese bakeries specialize in ultra-soft, slightly sweet bread that stays fresh longer than Western-style bread. A good bakery masters the art of pillowy, cloud-like textures, whether it’s a simple milk bun or a BBQ pork bun (叉烧包).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fresh, Quality Ingredients
Great Chinese bakeries don’t cut corners on ingredients. The best ones use premium flour, fresh dairy, and just the right amount of sugar and fat to create that signature light-yet-indulgent taste.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Balanced Sweet &amp; Savory Offerings
A top-tier Chinese bakery excels in both sweet and savory items. You should be able to grab a pineapple bun (菠萝包) in the same place you get a ham-and-cheese bun or a flaky egg tart (蛋挞). Variety is key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beautifully Golden, Shiny Tops
Chinese-style bread and pastries often have a distinct shiny, golden-brown finish, thanks to egg washes and glazes. If the bread looks dull or dry, that’s a bad sign.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Melt-in-Your-Mouth Pastries
From egg tarts to wife cakes (老婆饼), the best Chinese bakeries get their pastry game right—crispy, flaky, and light, without being too greasy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency is Everything
Every bun, roll, and pastry should have the same high standard—no lopsided egg tarts or dry bread from yesterday. The best bakeries bake fresh daily and keep their quality in check.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Affordable Yet Satisfying
Chinese bakeries have always been about offering delicious, high-quality baked goods at reasonable prices. A good one doesn’t overcharge—after all, nothing beats the satisfaction of grabbing a bag of buns for a few dollars.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A truly great Chinese bakery keeps you coming back—not just for nostalgia, but because everything tastes as good as you remember (or better).</p>

<h3 id="what-are-western-bakeries">What are Western bakeries?</h3>

<p>Western bakeries are bakeries that follow European or American baking traditions, focusing on rich, buttery pastries, crusty bread, and decadent cakes. Originating from countries like France, Italy, Germany, and the U.S., these bakeries are known for their use of high-fat dairy, laminated doughs, and fermentation techniques to create everything from flaky croissants to rustic sourdough loaves. They often emphasize texture—whether it’s the crispiness of a baguette, the airy layers of a Danish, or the dense chew of a brownie. Many Western bakeries in Singapore serve classic French viennoiseries, British tea cakes, or American-style cupcakes, often with a modern twist. If you’ve ever searched for a “bakery near me” to satisfy your craving for croissants or pastries, chances are, you’ve stepped into a Western bakery.</p>

<h3 id="pastries-that-western-bakeries-sell-in-singapore">Pastries that western bakeries sell in Singapore</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Croissant – Buttery, flaky, and best enjoyed fresh. The benchmark of any good Western bakery.</li>
  <li>Pain au Chocolat – A croissant, but with chocolate inside. Because everything is better with chocolate.</li>
  <li>Danish Pastry – Flaky, sweet, and often topped with fruit, custard, or cream cheese.</li>
  <li>Éclair – A choux pastry filled with cream and topped with chocolate glaze. Fancy and delicious.</li>
  <li>Canelé – A small, caramelized French pastry with a custardy inside and crisp outer shell.</li>
  <li>Madeleine – A tiny, shell-shaped butter cake with a light, airy texture. Perfect with tea.</li>
  <li>Macaron – Delicate almond meringue cookies sandwiched with ganache or buttercream. A true test of a baker’s skill.</li>
  <li>Scone – Dense yet crumbly, often enjoyed with clotted cream and jam. Best paired with tea.</li>
  <li>Kouign-Amann – A caramelized, buttery pastry from Brittany, often called a “croissant on steroids.”</li>
  <li>Brioche – Soft, slightly sweet bread with a high butter content. Makes excellent French toast.</li>
  <li>Galette – A rustic, free-form pastry filled with fruit or savory toppings.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-western-bakery-good">What makes a Western bakery good?</h3>

<p>A good Western bakery isn’t just about selling overpriced croissants—it’s about delivering quality, consistency, and flavor in every bite. Here’s what separates the best from the forgettable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flaky, Buttery Pastries – A proper croissant should shatter when you bite into it, not feel like soft bread. The more visible layers, the better.</li>
  <li>High-Quality Ingredients – Good butter, fresh cream, and proper flour make all the difference. European-style butter (like French AOP butter or cultured butter) gives pastries a richer taste, while high-fat dairy cream makes fillings smoother and more indulgent. If they skimp on these, you’ll taste it.</li>
  <li>Bread That’s Worth the Carbs – A crispy baguette, chewy sourdough, or soft brioche should have a great crust, a perfect crumb, and depth of flavor.</li>
  <li>Balance of Sweet and Savory – A strong mix of offerings, from pain au chocolat to quiches, ensures there’s something for everyone.</li>
  <li>Attention to Technique – Whether it’s a laminated pastry or a slow-fermented dough, top bakeries take the time to get it right.</li>
  <li>Consistency – No one wants a great croissant one day and a sad, soggy one the next. The best bakeries deliver the same high standard daily.</li>
  <li>Freshness – If the pastries taste like they’ve been sitting around all day, it’s a no-go. A great bakery bakes fresh, multiple times a day.</li>
  <li>Aromatic and Inviting – A proper Western bakery should smell like heaven—warm butter, fresh bread, and caramelized sugar. If it doesn’t, turn around.</li>
  <li>Presentation and Aesthetic – Let’s be honest, you eat with your eyes first. Good Western bakeries make their pastries look as good as they taste.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-japanese-bakeries">What are Japanese bakeries?</h3>

<p>Japanese bakeries are where precision meets perfection, combining European baking techniques with Japanese craftsmanship and a deep love for soft, fluffy textures. Unlike the heavy, butter-rich pastries of traditional Western bakeries, Japanese baked goods are lighter, airier, and often subtly sweet. Think shokupan (Japanese milk bread) that’s impossibly soft, melon pan with its crispy cookie-like crust, and matcha-infused everything because, well, it’s Japan.</p>

<p>These bakeries are also known for their obsession with quality ingredients, often using premium Hokkaido butter, fresh cream, and high-grade flour. The result? Pastries and bread that are almost too pretty to eat but way too delicious not to. And because Japan loves convenience, many of these bakeries offer beautifully packaged, grab-and-go options that make it dangerously easy to overbuy.</p>

<p>In Singapore, Japanese bakeries have gained a cult following for their flawless presentation, balanced flavors, and that signature melt-in-your-mouth texture. Whether you’re after a croissant filled with custard, a pillowy anpan (red bean bun), or a slice of the fluffiest cheesecake imaginable, Japanese bakeries prove that less is more—except when it comes to quality.</p>

<h3 id="pastries-that-japanese-bakeries-sell">Pastries That Japanese Bakeries Sell</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Shokupan – Fluffy, pillowy milk bread that’s dangerously easy to eat.</li>
  <li>Melon Pan – A sweet bun covered in a thin cookie crust, with zero melon flavor despite the name.</li>
  <li>Anpan – A soft bread roll filled with sweet red bean paste. A Japanese classic.</li>
  <li>Chiffon Cake – Airy, light, and slightly bouncy. Feels like eating a cloud.</li>
  <li>Castella Cake – A spongy, honey-flavored cake introduced by the Portuguese, now a Japanese favorite.</li>
  <li>Japanese Cheesecake – Less dense than its Western counterpart, it wobbles like a dream.</li>
  <li>Matcha Swiss Roll – A green tea-flavored sponge cake rolled with light cream.</li>
  <li>Yuzu Tart – A citrusy twist on the classic tart, with a refreshing Japanese touch.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-japanese-bakery-good">What makes a Japanese bakery good?</h3>

<p>A good Japanese bakery isn’t just about selling bread—it’s about perfection in every bite. Here’s what separates the great from the average:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Flawless Textures
Japanese bakeries are known for their soft, airy, and perfectly structured bread. Whether it’s the pillowy shokupan (milk bread) or the crisp-on-the-outside melon pan, the texture should be spot on—never too dense, never too dry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High-Quality Ingredients
The best Japanese bakeries don’t skimp on ingredients. Expect Hokkaido milk, premium Japanese flour, cultured butter, and fresh cream. The type of butter and cream used matters the most—this is what gives Japanese bread its signature rich yet delicate taste.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Balance of Flavors
Unlike Western pastries that can be overly rich, Japanese baked goods strike a perfect balance between sweetness and subtlety. You’ll find just the right amount of matcha, red bean, or custard—flavors that shine without overwhelming your taste buds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Precision &amp; Presentation
Everything in a Japanese bakery looks like it was made with surgical precision—because it was. Breads and pastries are often uniform in size, beautifully golden, and wrapped neatly. A messy Japanese bakery? That’s a red flag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creativity with Tradition
A top-tier Japanese bakery respects tradition but isn’t afraid to innovate. Look for modern takes on classic favorites—like matcha croissants, yuzu cream buns, or sakura-infused pastries—because why not make perfection even better?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>At its core, a great Japanese bakery makes you question why all bread isn’t this good—and has you walking out with more pastries than you planned for.</p>

<p>These exclusive spaces offer everything from plush seating and free-flowing snacks to showers and even nap pods—because nothing says “I’m winning at travel” like dozing off in a private suite while others scramble for overpriced coffee. But not all lounges are created equal; some require a premium credit card, an expensive membership, or simply flying in business class (which, let’s be honest, most of us dream about but rarely book). Of course, there’s also a hierarchy within lounges—economy class travelers with access get the basics, while business class lounges serve up gourmet meals and champagne, just to remind you that there’s a whole other world beyond economy. In this guide, we’ll explore how to get into these lounges, the different memberships available, a list of Changi Airport’s best options, the top airport lounges globally, and a few truly special ones that take luxury to another level.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-airport-lounges">What are airport lounges?</h3>

<p>Airport lounges are private spaces within airports designed to offer travelers a more comfortable and exclusive experience away from the chaos of the main terminal. Depending on the lounge, you might get access to plush seating, complimentary food and drinks, high-speed Wi-Fi, showers, and even nap rooms—basically, everything you wish the airport had but only a select few can enjoy. Some lounges cater specifically to business and first-class passengers, while others allow access through memberships, credit card perks, or one-time passes. The goal? To make waiting for a flight feel less like an endurance test and more like a VIP experience. Of course, not all lounges are created equal—some are a paradise of luxury, while others barely offer more than a quiet place to sit and a bowl of instant noodles.</p>

<p>This Japanese discount chain has taken Singapore by storm, stuffing its stores with everything from groceries to premium strawberries to bizarre beauty gadgets you never knew you needed. Since opening its first store here in 2017, Don Don Donki has expanded aggressively, because apparently, we can’t get enough of Japanese snacks and household randomness. With locations scattered across the island (yes, even in heartland malls now), it’s almost too easy to fall into the trap of “just browsing” and leaving with a bag full of Hokkaido milk and mochi. And let’s not forget the iconic theme song—composed to burrow into your brain forever—because nothing says “welcome to our store” like a never-ending loop of “Don Don Don, Donki~.”. One of my favourite <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/grocery/">grocery chains</a>!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-don-don-don-ki-dddk">What is Don don don ki (DDDK)?</h3>

<p>Don Don Donki, also known as Donki, Don Donki, Don Ki Don Ki, Don Don Ki, or DDDK, is a Japanese discount store chain that sells a dizzying variety of products, from fresh produce to quirky household items. Originally called Don Quijote in Japan, the brand is famous for its tightly packed aisles, bright neon signs, and an inescapable jingle that somehow makes shopping feel like an adventure. Unlike your typical supermarket, Don Don Donki specializes in Japanese goods, making it the go-to spot for fans. Whether you’re after premium Japanese ingredients or just need a last-minute souvenir that screams kawaii, Don Don Donki probably has it—somewhere in the maze of its shelves. Just be prepared to leave with more than you planned, because resisting a good Japanese snack haul is nearly impossible.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-dddk-in-singapore">History of DDDK in Singapore</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Origins in Japan: Don Don Donki, originally known as Don Quijote, was founded in 1980 in Japan as a discount store selling a mix of household goods, groceries, and quirky items.</li>
  <li>Expansion Across Japan: The brand rapidly grew into a nationwide chain, known for its chaotic layout, late-night hours, and endless variety of products.</li>
  <li>International Expansion: Don Quijote rebranded its overseas stores as Don Don Donki to differentiate them from its Japanese outlets and started expanding into Asia.</li>
  <li>Entry into Singapore (2017): The first Don Don Donki Singapore store opened in Orchard Central in December 2017, instantly drawing crowds eager for authentic Japanese products.</li>
  <li>Rapid Growth: Due to its massive popularity, Don Don Donki quickly expanded across Singapore, with multiple locations opening in malls, heartland areas, and even 24-hour outlets to satisfy Singaporeans’ love for all things Japanese.</li>

<h3 id="who-composed-the-dddk-song-and-why-is-it-so-catchy">Who composed the DDDK song and why is it so catchy?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Composer: The Don Don Donki theme song (also known as the “Miracle Shopping” song) was composed by Takahiro Yamato, a Japanese musician and producer.</li>
  <li>Original Purpose: The song was originally created for Don Quijote Japan in 1999 as a fun, energetic jingle to enhance the shopping experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Catchiness Factor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Repetitive lyrics – The words “Don Don Don, Donki~” are impossible to forget after hearing them a few times.</li>
  <li>Upbeat melody – The song’s high-energy, fast-paced rhythm keeps customers engaged.</li>
  <li>Psychological influence – The tune is designed to create a sense of excitement and urgency, encouraging shoppers to stay longer and buy more.</li>
  <li>Singapore’s Love for It: Just like bubble tea, the song is annoyingly addictive, and most Singaporeans probably hum it in their heads even when they don’t want to.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-type-of-products-does-dddk-sell">What type of products does DDDK sell?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Japanese Everything – Singaporeans have an obsession with Japan, from sushi to anime, so a store filled with authentic Japanese products is an instant win.</li>
  <li>Affordable “Imported” Goods – Unlike other specialty Japanese stores, Don Don Donki makes Japanese snacks, beauty products, and groceries accessible without outrageous markups.</li>
  <li>Quality Goods – From premium Japanese strawberries to freshly imported Wagyu, the store offers high-quality products that justify their price tags.</li>
  <li>Chaotic but Fun Shopping Experience – The maze-like layout and bright, flashy displays turn a simple grocery run into an adventure (or a test of patience, depending on the crowd).</li>
  <li>Discounted Hot Food After 8:30 PM – Savvy shoppers know that bentos, sushi, and other ready-to-eat meals get marked down in the evening, making it the perfect time to score a deal.</li>
  <li>That Catchy Song – Love it or hate it, the “Don Don Don, Donki~” jingle plays on repeat, embedding itself into Singaporeans’ brains like a permanent earworm.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-products-can-you-buy-in-dddk">What products can you buy in DDDK?</h3>

<p>My go-tos</p>

<ul>
  <li>Niigata Rice – Premium, aromatic rice from Japan’s Niigata prefecture, known for its soft texture and superior taste.</li>
  <li>Pork Jowl – Tender, flavorful cuts of pork with a good balance of meat and fat, perfect for grilling or hotpot.</li>
  <li>Beef Shabu Frozen – Thinly sliced beef ideal for shabu-shabu, a Japanese hotpot dish, offering a melt-in-your-mouth experience.</li>
  <li>Unsweetened Soy Milk – A creamy, plant-based milk option with no added sugars, great for cooking or drinking.</li>
  <li>Sanuki Udon – Thick, chewy Japanese noodles from the Kagawa region, perfect for a comforting bowl of udon soup.</li>
  <li>Spring Onion – Fresh and vibrant, these add a burst of flavor and crunch to any dish, especially in stir-fries or soups. Tastes different from the spring onion coming from Malaysia</li>
  <li>Mizkan Nabe Soup Base – A ready-to-use broth base for hotpot, delivering authentic Japanese flavors with ease.</li>
  <li>Frozen Meatballs – Convenient and versatile, these frozen meatballs are perfect for quick meals like soups or skewers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, I mostly get my meats from Hubers butchery or Foodies Market Place.</p>

<h3 id="what-ready-to-eat-foods-to-buy-in-dddk">What ready to eat foods to buy in DDDK?</h3>

<p>My go-tos</p>
<ul>
  <li>Negitoro Bowl – A delicious bowl of finely minced tuna and spring onions, perfect for a fresh, savory meal.</li>
  <li>Chirashi Bowl – A colorful and satisfying bowl of sushi rice topped with a variety of fresh sashimi and garnishes.</li>
  <li>Cream Croquette – Crispy on the outside, creamy and rich on the inside, this is a comforting and indulgent snack.</li>
  <li>Millefeuille – A delicate layered pastry, filled with rich cream, offering a sweet and light treat.</li>
  <li>Katsudon – A hearty bowl of rice topped with a crispy pork cutlet, egg, and savory sauce, ideal for a filling meal.</li>
  <li>Yakisoba – Stir-fried noodles with vegetables, sauce, and your choice of meat or seafood, offering a tasty, savory dish.</li>
  <li>Takoyaki – Soft, doughy balls filled with octopus and topped with takoyaki sauce and bonito flakes, making for a flavorful snack.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fried Foods – Like fried chicken or tempura (unless you’re in the mood for extra grease).</li>
  <li>Yakitori Skewers – Because sometimes skewered meat just isn’t the right choice for a fulfilling meal.</li>
  <li>Pizza – Even if it’s ‘Japanese-style’, it’s still pizza…</li>
</ul>

This is a must-know for your upcoming <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-flights/">vacations</a>!</p>

<p>In Singapore, where Changi Airport is basically a five-star hotel with runways, picking the right airline alliance can make or break your travel perks. The big three—Star Alliance, Oneworld, and SkyTeam—each promise elite treatment, but only if you’re loyal enough (or fly enough to justify your existence to them). We’ll break down what each alliance offers, from lounge access to priority boarding, and whether they’re actually worth your commitment. And, of course, we’ll answer the golden question: which airline alliance should you really be pledging your miles to in Singapore?</p>

<h3 id="what-are-airline-alliances">What are airline alliances?</h3>

<p>Airline alliances are partnerships between multiple airlines that allow them to share routes, services, and benefits for passengers. Instead of each airline operating independently, they team up to offer perks like easier flight connections, shared frequent flyer miles, and access to airport lounges across different carriers. The three major global airline alliances—Star Alliance, Oneworld, and SkyTeam—essentially function as VIP clubs, giving travelers better treatment if they stick to the same network. For airlines, it means cost savings and a wider global reach; for passengers, it means you might actually get a decent layover experience instead of sprinting through an unfamiliar airport. In Singapore, where Changi Airport is already a traveler’s paradise, the right airline alliance can make your journeys even smoother—or at least slightly less exhausting.</p>

<h3 id="deep-dive-into-top-3-airline-alliances">Deep dive into top 3 airline alliances</h3>

<p><u>Star Alliance – The OG of Airline Alliances<u></u></u></p>

<p>Founded: 1997
Why It Matters: Star Alliance is the largest and oldest airline alliance, formed when five airlines decided they liked each other enough to team up. Today, it has the most airline members and the widest global coverage. Singapore Airlines (SIA) is a key member, meaning Star Alliance perks are highly relevant for travelers in Singapore.</p>

<p>Current Airline Partners: 26 members, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Singapore Airlines (Singapore)</li>
  <li>Lufthansa (Germany)</li>
  <li>United Airlines (USA)</li>
  <li>ANA (All Nippon Airways) (Japan)</li>
  <li>Thai Airways (Thailand)</li>
  <li>Turkish Airlines (Turkey)</li>
  <li>Swiss International Air Lines (Switzerland)</li>
  <li>Air Canada (Canada)
(and many more covering over 190 countries)</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Oneworld – The Premium Traveler’s Choice<u></u></u></p>

<p>Founded: 1999
Why It Matters: Oneworld was built for business travelers who care about premium perks and seamless connections. It’s smaller than Star Alliance but focuses on quality over quantity, with Cathay Pacific (Hong Kong) and Qantas (Australia) being key players in the region.</p>

<p>Current Airline Partners: 13 members, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Qantas (Australia)</li>
  <li>British Airways (UK)</li>
  <li>American Airlines (USA)</li>
  <li>Cathay Pacific (Hong Kong)</li>
  <li>Japan Airlines (JAL) (Japan)</li>
  <li>Finnair (Finland)</li>
  <li>Qatar Airways (Qatar)
(plus others with strong intercontinental coverage)</li>
</ul>

<p><u>SkyTeam – The Underdog That’s Still in the Game<u></u></u></p>

<p>Founded: 2000
Why It Matters: SkyTeam was the last of the three major alliances to form and often feels like the “third choice” for frequent flyers. It has strong coverage in Europe and Asia, but fewer premium perks compared to the other two. However, its focus on airlines from China and the Middle East makes it a decent option for specific routes.</p>

<p>Current Airline Partners: 18 members, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>KLM (Netherlands)</li>
  <li>Air France (France)</li>
  <li>Korean Air (South Korea)</li>
  <li>China Eastern Airlines (China)</li>
  <li>Delta Air Lines (USA)</li>
  <li>Vietnam Airlines (Vietnam)</li>
  <li>Garuda Indonesia (Indonesia)
(and others, with strong regional ties in Europe and Asia)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-the-star-alliance-tiers-and-benefits-would-you-get">What are the Star alliance tiers and benefits would you get?</h3>

<p><u>Star Alliance Tiers and Benefits<u></u></u></p>

<p>Star Alliance offers two elite status tiers: Star Alliance Silver and Star Alliance Gold. These are earned through your frequent flyer status with individual member airlines—so if you’re flying Singapore Airlines, for example, your KrisFlyer Elite Silver or PPS Club status translates into Star Alliance perks.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Star Alliance Silver – The “Nice Try” Tier</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the lower-tier status, and, well… don’t expect much. The benefits are minimal, and you’ll still feel like a regular passenger most of the time.
Benefits:
✅ Priority waitlisting – If your flight is fully booked, you might get a seat before non-status passengers. Might.
✅ Priority standby – If you need to change your flight last-minute, you may get a better spot on the waitlist.</p>

<p>What’s missing?
❌ No lounge access
❌ No priority check-in or boarding
❌ No extra baggage allowance</p>

<ol>
  <li>Star Alliance Gold – The “Finally, Some Respect” Tier</li>
</ol>

<p>This is where things get better. Star Alliance Gold is the real reason people chase status—it actually gives you perks that make traveling less of a hassle.</p>

<p>Benefits:
✅ Lounge access – Free access to over 1,000 Star Alliance lounges worldwide, no matter what cabin class you’re flying. (Yes, even if you’re in economy!)
✅ Priority check-in – Use the business class or first-class check-in counters even if you’re flying economy.
✅ Extra baggage allowance – Usually an extra 20kg or one extra piece of luggage (varies by airline).
✅ Priority boarding – Skip the long queue and board early with business and first-class passengers.
✅ Priority baggage handling – Your bags come out first at baggage claim, so you can leave the airport faster.
✅ Priority standby and waitlisting – More likely to get on an earlier or oversold flight.</p>

<p><u>How to Earn Star Alliance Status in Singapore?<u></u></u></p>

<p>For Singapore-based travelers, your best bet is through Singapore Airlines’ KrisFlyer program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>KrisFlyer Elite Silver → Star Alliance Silver (not really worth the effort)</li>
  <li>KrisFlyer Elite Gold or PPS Club/Solitaire PPS Club → Star Alliance Gold (this is the one you want!)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fly often with Singapore Airlines or other Star Alliance carriers, reaching Gold status can make your trips much smoother. But if you’re stuck at Silver, don’t expect anything more than a pat on the back.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-one-world-tiers-and-benefits-would-you-get">What are the One World tiers and benefits would you get?</h3>

<p><u>Oneworld Tiers and Benefits<u></u></u></p>

<p>Oneworld has three elite status tiers: Oneworld Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. Unlike Star Alliance, where the lower-tier Silver status is almost useless, Oneworld actually offers decent perks even at the mid-tier levels.
Your Oneworld status is based on your frequent flyer status with member airlines. For example, if you fly Qantas, British Airways, or Cathay Pacific, their elite tiers translate into Oneworld benefits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Oneworld Ruby – The “Better Than Nothing” Tier
This is the entry-level status, and while it’s not much, at least you get some priority treatment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Benefits:
✅ Business class check-in counters – Even if you’re flying economy, you can skip the long economy check-in lines.
✅ Priority waitlisting – If your flight is full, you might get a seat before non-status passengers.
✅ Priority standby – If you need to change your flight, you get priority over others on the waitlist.</p>

<p>What’s missing?
❌ No lounge access
❌ No priority boarding
❌ No extra baggage allowance</p>

<p><u>How to get Oneworld Ruby in Singapore?<u>

<ol>
  <li>Oneworld Sapphire – The “Now We’re Talking” Tier
This is the mid-tier status, and it’s where the real benefits start kicking in.</li>
</ol>

<p>Benefits:
✅ Lounge access – Free access to over 600 Oneworld Business Class lounges worldwide, even if you’re flying economy.
✅ Priority check-in – Use business class check-in counters.
✅ Priority boarding – Board early with business class passengers.
✅ Extra baggage allowance – Typically an extra checked bag or extra weight, depending on the airline.
✅ Priority baggage handling – Your bags come out first at baggage claim.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Oneworld Emerald – The “Now You’re Basically Royalty” Tier
This is the highest tier, and it gets you nearly the same perks as first-class passengers, no matter what ticket you have.</li>
</ol>

<p>Benefits:
✅ First-class lounge access – You can use first-class lounges, including the famous Qantas First Lounge in Changi Airport.
✅ Priority security and immigration – Some airports have fast-track lanes for Emerald members.
✅ First-class check-in – Skip the lines entirely and check in where actual first-class passengers do.
✅ Priority boarding – Board first, before everyone else.
✅ Extra baggage allowance – More weight or extra checked bags, depending on the airline.
✅ Priority baggage handling – Your bags are among the first to arrive at baggage claim.</p>

Qantas Frequent Flyer Platinum</u></u></p>

<p><u>Is Oneworld Status Worth It in Singapore?<u></u></u></p>

<p>If you travel frequently with Qantas, Cathay Pacific, or Japan Airlines, Oneworld status is worth considering. The real sweet spot is Sapphire, since that gets you lounge access even on economy tickets. But if you’re lucky enough to reach Emerald, you’ll be skipping lines and sipping champagne in first-class lounges while everyone else fights for overhead bin space.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-skyteam-tiers-and-benefits-would-you-get">What are the SkyTeam tiers and benefits would you get?</h3>

<p><u>SkyTeam Tiers and Benefits<u></u></u></p>

<p>SkyTeam keeps things simple with just two elite tiers: SkyTeam Elite and SkyTeam Elite Plus. While it doesn’t have as many perks as Oneworld or Star Alliance, SkyTeam still offers some useful benefits—especially if you fly with partners like Korean Air, China Eastern, or Vietnam Airlines from Singapore.</p>

<p>Your SkyTeam status depends on your frequent flyer program. For example, if you fly with Korean Air’s SKYPASS, your elite status gets mapped to SkyTeam’s benefits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>SkyTeam Elite – The “Okay, You Exist” Tier
This is the entry-level status, and while it’s better than nothing, it’s not exactly life-changing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Benefits:
✅ Priority check-in – Use the dedicated SkyTeam Elite check-in counters instead of the long economy lines.
✅ Priority boarding – Board early, though usually after business class and Elite Plus members.
✅ Extra baggage allowance – Usually an extra 10kg or one additional checked bag.
✅ Priority standby and waitlisting – You have a better chance of getting a seat on full flights.</p>

<p>What’s missing?
❌ No lounge access
❌ No priority security or immigration
❌ No priority baggage handling</p>

<ol>
  <li>SkyTeam Elite Plus – The “Finally, Some Real Perks” Tier

</ol>

<p>Benefits:
✅ Lounge access – Free access to 750+ SkyTeam lounges worldwide, even when flying economy.
✅ Priority check-in – Use the business class check-in counters.
✅ Priority boarding – Board earlier than most other passengers.
✅ Extra baggage allowance – Typically an additional checked bag or extra weight.
✅ Priority baggage handling – Your luggage comes out first at baggage claim.

<p><u>How to get SkyTeam Elite Plus in Singapore?<u>
Korean Air SKYPASS Morning Calm Premium Club or higher
Vietnam Airlines Lotusmiles Platinum
China Eastern Eastern Miles Platinum</u></u></p>

<p><u>Is SkyTeam Status Worth It in Singapore?<u></u></u></p>

<p>If you fly Korean Air or Vietnam Airlines often, SkyTeam Elite Plus is nice to have for the lounge access and priority treatment. But compared to Star Alliance (with Singapore Airlines) or Oneworld (with Cathay Pacific and Qantas), SkyTeam isn’t as dominant in Singapore. So unless you love flying to Seoul or Shanghai, you might not find this alliance as rewarding.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-select-airline-alliances-to-be-a-part-of">How do you select airline alliances to be a part of?</h3>

<p><u>How to Choose the Right Airline Alliance<u></u></u></p>

<p>Picking the right airline alliance isn’t just about collecting miles—it’s about maximizing perks, convenience, and value. Here’s how to decide which one works best for you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Look at Your Most Frequent Airlines
If you mainly fly Singapore Airlines, Star Alliance is the obvious choice.
If you travel often with Cathay Pacific or Qantas, Oneworld is a better fit.
If you fly to Korea, China, or Vietnam often, SkyTeam might be worth considering.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your alliance choice should align with your home airport and preferred routes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compare Lounge Access and Perks</li>
</ol>

<p>Star Alliance Gold: Gets you into over 1,000+ lounges, including KrisFlyer Gold Lounges.
Oneworld Sapphire/Emerald: Business and First Class lounges, even on economy tickets.
SkyTeam Elite Plus: Lounge access, but fewer high-end lounge options compared to Oneworld.</p>

<p>If you value luxury and priority treatment, Oneworld Emerald is the strongest.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check the Elite Status Benefits That Matter Most</li>
</ol>

<p>Do you want extra baggage? → All alliances offer it, but Star Alliance is the most generous.
Do you care about priority check-in/security? → Oneworld Emerald has the best fast-track benefits.
Do you want guaranteed seats on sold-out flights? → SkyTeam Elite Plus offers this on certain fares.</p>

<p>Are you flying budget airlines a lot? → None of these will help—you’ll need individual airline memberships.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Consider How Easy It Is to Earn and Keep Status</li>
</ol>

<p>Singapore Airlines’ KrisFlyer status resets annually, making it harder to maintain.
Qantas and Cathay Pacific have more flexible status rules with rolling qualification periods.
SkyTeam programs like Korean Air SKYPASS require more long-haul flights to qualify.</p>

<p>If you don’t fly often but want lifetime benefits, some programs (like SKYPASS) offer lifetime elite status.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Think About Redemption Value and Partner Flights</li>
</ol>

<p>Star Alliance has the biggest network (26 airlines), great for long-haul trips.
Oneworld miles are easier to redeem for business and first-class awards.
SkyTeam often has poor redemption availability—using miles for upgrades is harder.</p>

<p>If you travel a lot and want flexibility, Star Alliance gives the most options.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Choose the alliance that matches your travel patterns, gives you the best perks, and has partners that actually fly where you need to go.</p>

<h3 id="which-airline-alliance-is-best-for-singapore">Which airline alliance is best for Singapore?</h3>

<p>Most people in Singapore choose Star Alliance—and it’s not hard to see why. With Singapore Airlines (SQ) as a founding member, Star Alliance dominates Changi Airport, offering the most flights, lounges, and perks. But not everyone starts fresh in Singapore. If you’ve moved here from Hong Kong, Australia, or even Europe, you might already have elite status with Oneworld or SkyTeam, making it harder to switch.</p>

<p>For example, I stuck with Oneworld Sapphire for a long time because of Marco Polo Gold with Cathay Pacific. It gave me lounge access, priority check-in, and extra baggage—perks I didn’t want to give up even after moving to Singapore. Similarly, frequent travelers from Korea or China might find SkyTeam Elite Plus more useful if they still fly with Korean Air or China Eastern often.
So while Star Alliance is the default winner for most Singapore-based flyers, some people keep their Oneworld or SkyTeam loyalty because of past status and travel patterns. The best choice? Stick with what gives you the most perks based on your usual routes and airlines—even if it’s not Star Alliance.</p>

If you’ve ever dreamed of soaking in a hot spring or onsen while pretending you’re in a serene Japanese ryokan, you’re not alone.</p>

<p>Onsens, Japan’s natural hot springs, aren’t just for relaxation; they’re practically a cultural experience, offering everything from therapeutic benefits to a great excuse to let your mind wander while you sit in glorified boiling water. Whether you’re opting for the traditional full experience in a ryokan or just day-tripping to a local onsen, there’s something about those steamy waters that make you feel like you’re doing something good for your body—even if all you’re really doing is sitting there. From health benefits like improved circulation to the variety of onsens—from public baths to luxurious resort-style ones—there’s something to suit every mood, day or night. So, are there any onsens in Singapore that can compare to Japan’s? Well, let’s just say we might not have Mount Fuji nearby, but there’s always a chance to dip your toes into a little hot water.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-onsens">What are onsens?</h3>

<p>Onsens are natural hot springs found in Japan, created by geothermal activity that heats the water, making it perfect for bathing. These springs are rich in minerals like sulfur, sodium, and calcium, which are believed to have therapeutic effects on the body, helping with ailments like joint pain, skin conditions, and stress. People flock to onsens not just for the healing properties of the water but for the whole experience—taking time to relax, unwind, and connect with nature in a serene environment. Onsens can be found in both public baths and private settings, often nestled in scenic areas like mountains or forests, providing a peaceful escape. Whether you’re soaking in a rustic outdoor bath or indulging in a luxurious resort-style onsen, the practice is deeply woven into Japanese culture.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-ryokans">What are ryokans?</h3>

<p>Ryokans are traditional Japanese inns that offer a unique and immersive cultural experience. Staying in a ryokan is like stepping back in time, where you get to enjoy tatami mat floors, sliding paper doors, and futon beds laid out for you at night. The real draw, though, is the hospitality—often, ryokans include kaiseki meals (a multi-course feast) and access to private onsens, making it an all-in-one retreat. These inns are located in scenic areas, sometimes close to onsens, giving you the perfect mix of relaxation and tradition. It’s the ultimate way to experience Japan’s famous blend of simplicity and elegance, with a touch of “you’ll never want to leave” comfort.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-ryokans-and-onsens">History of ryokans and onsens</h3>

<p>Ryokans and onsens have deep roots in Japanese history, both playing crucial roles in the country’s cultural and social fabric. Ryokans date back to the 8th century during the Nara period, originally serving as resting spots for travelers along Japan’s ancient roads. Over time, these inns evolved into luxurious retreats, offering not only a place to stay but a way to experience traditional Japanese customs, food, and hospitality. On the other hand, onsens have been used for thousands of years, with their therapeutic properties first recognized as early as the 8th century as well. They became especially popular during the Edo period (1603-1868) when people began to frequent them for both health reasons and relaxation. Together, ryokans and onsens have become symbols of Japanese culture, offering both locals and tourists a way to unwind, enjoy nature, and connect with centuries-old traditions.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-people-like-going-to-onsens">Why do people like going to onsens?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Relaxation – The warm, mineral-rich waters soothe sore muscles and ease tension, offering a calming escape from daily stress. Onsen water temperatures typically range from 38°C to 42°C (100°F to 108°F), providing the perfect balance between comfort and therapeutic warmth.</li>
  <li>Health Benefits – Onsen waters are rich in minerals like sulfur, sodium chloride, and calcium, which are believed to help with a variety of health conditions. Regular soaking can improve blood circulation, alleviate muscle and joint pain, and promote detoxification. Sulfur-rich baths, for instance, are known for their skin-healing properties and can help treat conditions like eczema and psoriasis.</li>
  <li>Nature Immersion – Many onsens are located in scenic areas, allowing bathers to enjoy natural beauty while unwinding. The calming environment is scientifically shown to lower stress hormone levels and promote a sense of overall well-being.</li>
  <li>Cultural Experience – The rituals involved in bathing at an onsen, such as thoroughly cleaning before soaking, offer a unique chance to immerse in Japanese tradition. The process itself encourages mindfulness, which has been linked to reduced anxiety and improved mental health.</li>
  <li>Self-Care – It’s a guilt-free excuse to relax and do nothing, all while feeling like you’re indulging in wellness and rejuvenation. Studies have shown that thermal baths can improve sleep quality and even boost immune function, making an onsen visit feel even more rewarding.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="risks-of-going-to-onsens--when-should-you-not-go-to-an-onsen">Risks of going to onsens / when should you not go to an onsen</h3>

<p>While onsens offer a lot of benefits, there are some risks and situations where it’s best to avoid them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High-Temperature Sensitivity – If you’re sensitive to heat or have a condition like high blood pressure or heart problems, the hot water can be overwhelming and cause dizziness or fainting. It’s important to listen to your body and avoid prolonged soaking in very hot water.</li>
  <li>Pregnancy – Pregnant women should avoid onsens, especially those with very hot water, as the heat can raise body temperature and potentially harm the fetus. Some onsens have specific pools for expectant mothers, but it’s safest to consult a doctor before going.</li>
  <li>Open Wounds or Skin Infections – If you have open cuts, wounds, or active skin infections like rashes or boils, it’s best to stay out of the onsen. The hot water can irritate wounds and potentially introduce bacteria.</li>
  <li>Alcohol Consumption – Going into an onsen after drinking alcohol can increase the risk of dehydration, overheating, or fainting due to the combination of alcohol and the hot water. It’s better to enjoy your soak when sober.</li>
  <li>Medical Conditions – If you have conditions like diabetes, respiratory issues, or circulatory problems, consult a doctor before entering an onsen, as hot water can exacerbate certain health concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule, always remember to stay hydrated, limit your soaking time, and be mindful of how your body reacts to the heat. If you’re feeling unwell, it’s best to skip the onsen altogether.</p>

<h3 id="etiquettes-of-going-to-an-onsen">Etiquettes of going to an onsen</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Shower First – Always wash and thoroughly rinse your body before entering the onsen. There is generally a designated area with shower stations for this purpose, equipped with stools, handheld showerheads, and soap. This is not only for hygiene but also a sign of respect for other bathers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep Your Hair Out of the Water – If you have long hair, tie it up to avoid it touching the water. Wet hair can transfer dirt and oils into the bath.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid Loud Noise – Keep conversations quiet and respectful. Onsens are meant to be peaceful, relaxing spaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Diving or Splashing – Don’t splash water or engage in any vigorous movement. Relaxing is key, not swimming or playing around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t Soak for Too Long – Limit your soak to around 15-20 minutes at a time. Too long can cause overheating and dehydration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Towels Stay Outside – Bring a small towel for washing, but leave it outside the onsen when you soak. It’s considered impolite to bring it into the water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Photography – Keep your phone and camera away to maintain the peaceful, private nature of the onsen and respect the privacy of others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be Respectful of Others’ Space – Onsens can be communal, so be mindful of personal space and avoid crowding other bathers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid Using Soap in the Bath – Soap should only be used during your pre-bath shower, not in the onsen itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rinse After Soaking – After enjoying the onsen, rinse off any residual minerals from your body. This helps cleanse your skin and closes your pores.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-do-they-give-you-a-little-face-towel-in-the-onsen">Why do they give you a little face towel in the onsen?</h3>

<p>The little towel given at the onsen serves several practical and cultural purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use to Wash Your Body in the Shower – You can use the towel to scrub and rinse your body during the pre-bath shower, helping with personal hygiene before entering the onsen. There is generally a designated area with shower stations for this purpose, equipped with stools, handheld showerheads, and soap. This ensures you’re thoroughly clean before soaking in the communal bath.</li>
  <li>Use to Wipe Sweat When in the Hot Bath – While soaking in the onsen, you can place the towel on your head or use it to wipe off sweat. This helps keep you comfortable while relaxing in the hot water.</li>
  <li>Use to Hide Your Body When Walking From One Bath to Another – The towel provides modesty as you move between bath areas. While you don’t bring it into the water, it’s a simple way to cover up while walking between different sections of the onsen.</li>
  <li>Use to Dry Off Before Stepping Back into the Changing Area – After your soak, the towel can be used to gently pat yourself dry before returning to the changing area, ensuring you don’t drip water onto the floor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The towel is a small but essential part of the onsen experience, helping maintain hygiene, respect for others, and adding to the overall cultural tradition.</p>

<h3 id="what-type-of-onsens-are-there">What type of onsens are there?</h3>

<p>There are several types of onsens, each offering a unique experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indoor Onsens (内湯, Uchiyu) – These are located inside buildings and are typically more private. They’re great for colder weather or those who prefer a more controlled environment. Indoor onsens often have beautifully tiled baths and a serene atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Outdoor Onsens (露天風呂, Rotenburo) – These are the iconic onsens that offer natural settings, with views of mountains, forests, or rivers. Soaking in an outdoor onsen, especially in cooler weather, provides a soothing contrast to the heat of the water.</li>
  <li>Private Onsens (貸切風呂, Kashikiri-buro) – These are smaller, more intimate baths that can be reserved for individuals or couples. They provide the experience of an onsen without the crowd, making them perfect for those who prefer privacy.</li>
  <li>Public Onsens (大浴場, Daiyokujou) – These are communal baths, often in large, open spaces where you can enjoy the onsen with other bathers. Public onsens are the most traditional and common in Japan.</li>
  <li>Day Onsens (日帰り温泉, Higaeri Onsen) – These are onsens that you can visit during the day, often included as part of a larger resort or hotel experience. They’re perfect for a relaxing afternoon soak and are sometimes combined with lunch or other wellness activities.</li>
  <li>Night Onsens (夜の温泉, Yoru no Onsen) – Some onsens are particularly magical at night, with tranquil, dimly-lit environments that enhance the sense of peace. Nighttime onsens offer a calm, almost mystical experience, where you can soak under the stars or in a quiet, candlelit room.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="where-are-the-onsens-in-japan">Where are the onsens in Japan?</h3>

<p>Onsens can be found all over Japan, from the snowy mountains of Hokkaido to the tropical islands of Okinawa.

<h3 id="are-there-any-onsens-in-singapore">Are there any onsens in Singapore?</h3>

<p>There are a few onsen experiences in Singapore, though they are not quite as abundant as in Japan. While Singapore doesn’t have natural hot spring resorts like those in Japan, it does have on-the-rise spa centers and wellness facilities that offer similar experiences to what you would find in an onsen. Here are a few places to check out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Yunomori Onsen &amp; Spa</li>
</ol>

<p>Location: Kallang Wave Mall
This is probably the most authentic onsen experience in Singapore. Yunomori features Japanese-style hot spring baths, including indoor and outdoor baths, a dry sauna, and a mud bath. While the waters aren’t natural hot springs, they provide a very similar relaxation experience.
Special Feature: Their wellness packages include spa treatments, massage, and relaxation therapies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Samsara Wellness</li>
</ol>

<p>Location: Queen Street
Samsara Wellness offers a unique blend of traditional Japanese onsen and modern wellness services. You can enjoy private onsen experiences along with body treatments that replicate the onsen experience.
Special Feature: They focus on combining natural treatments and relaxation with a Japanese-inspired aesthetic.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Aloha Sea Sports &amp; Onsen</li>
</ol>

<p>Location: East Coast
Although this is primarily a water sports center, they have onsen-style bathing areas in their wellness facilities that allow you to unwind after physical activity.
Special Feature: The onsen baths are designed to help soothe tired muscles and provide relaxation after outdoor activities.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spa Infinity</li>
</ol>

<p>Location: Orchard Road
While not an onsen per se, Spa Infinity offers experiences inspired by Japanese onsen, featuring a hot bath and relaxation treatments.
Special Feature: It focuses on combining high-tech wellness treatments with Japanese-inspired traditions.</p>

<h3 id="why-arent-there-more-onsens-in-singapore">Why Aren’t There More Onsens in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Singapore’s geological structure doesn’t support natural hot springs, so man-made onsen-like experiences are the closest option for those craving a taste of Japanese culture and relaxation. However, these spa centers do a pretty good job of recreating the onsen ambiance, making them great places for those looking to unwind in a familiar bathhouse atmosphere.

<p>What started as a modest purveyor of basics has evolved into Singapore’s go-to sanctuary for people who want to look put-together without looking like they’re trying too hard (and yes, we’re all guilty of owning at least five of their AIRism shirts). From the endless maze of outlets dotting our tiny island to their suspiciously addictive collaborations that make you question your financial decisions, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Singapore’s favorite Japanese casual wear retailer. Whether you’re a Uniqlo veteran who can spot a Heat Tech sale from a mile away, or a newcomer wondering why everyone seems to be wearing the same beige linen shirt, consider this your definitive playbook to mastering the art of Uniqlo shopping in Singapore. Between their strategic store locations that seem to follow you everywhere you go and their prices that make you wonder if you really need to eat this week, let’s dive into the wonderfully predictable world of Uniqlo Singapore.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-uniqlo">What is Uniqlo?</h3>

<p>Uniqlo is a Japanese casual wear brand known for its affordable, high-quality, and minimalist clothing. It specializes in simple, functional designs with innovative fabric technologies like HEATTECH (for warmth), AIRism (for breathability), and Ultra Light Down (for lightweight insulation).</p>

<p><u>History of Uniqlo<u></u></u></p>

<p>Uniqlo was founded in 1949 in Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan, originally as a textiles company called Ogori Shoji. In 1984, it rebranded and opened its first “Unique Clothing Warehouse” in Hiroshima, which was later shortened to Uniqlo. The brand expanded rapidly in Japan and internationally, becoming a global powerhouse under its parent company, Fast Retailing.</p>

<p><u>Uniqlo in Singapore<u></u></u></p>

<p>Uniqlo entered Singapore in 2009, opening its first store at Tampines 1. The brand quickly gained popularity due to its stylish yet practical clothing suited for Singapore’s tropical climate. Today, Uniqlo has more than 20 stores across the island, including flagship locations at Orchard Central and Jewel Changi Airport, as well as a strong online presence.</p>

<h3 id="ut-vs-uniqlo">UT vs Uniqlo</h3>

  <li>Main Focus: Uniqlo specializes in simple, everyday essentials, while UT is all about bold graphic T-shirts.</li>

<p>While Thailand’s recent surge in tourist-targeting scams has travelers clutching their passports a little tighter, Singapore’s scammers have been keeping themselves just as busy, proving that even our squeaky-clean reputation isn’t enough to keep the fraudsters away. In this guide, we’ll navigate through the jungle of Singaporean scams (from love scams that’ll break your heart and bank account simultaneously, to those suspiciously aggressive bank “officers” who seem more interested in your OTP than your actual banking needs), explore the latest tech-savvy protection measures, and share what to do if you’ve already sent your life savings to that charming person who totally promises they’re a Swedish billionaire (spoiler alert: they’re probably not).</p>

<h3 id="why-are-people-avoiding-travel-to-thailand">Why are people avoiding travel to Thailand?</h3>

<p>The recent decline in travel to Thailand is largely driven by rising safety concerns, particularly related to human trafficking and scam operations. A major issue is the growing presence of criminal syndicates operating near the Myanmar-Thailand border, where victims are lured into fraudulent job offers and subsequently trafficked into scam centers. These scam operations—often referred to as “pig butchering” scams—force victims to engage in fraudulent online activities, such as investment scams or romance scams, primarily targeting people in China and other countries.</p>

<p>The case of Chinese actor Wang Xing has brought significant attention to the dangers of these operations. He was reportedly deceived with a fake acting job in Thailand, only to be kidnapped and transported to Myanmar, where he was forced to participate in a scam targeting Chinese nationals. His case is just one of many instances where unsuspecting individuals, including tourists and job seekers, have fallen victim to human trafficking in the region.</p>

<p>The publicity surrounding this incident has led to widespread fear, particularly among Chinese travelers. As a result, many have canceled their plans to visit Thailand, leading to a sharp decline in chartered flights and hotel bookings. The situation has become so severe that even Chinese travel agencies are reporting a significant drop in demand for Thailand trips, despite the country being one of the most popular travel destinations for Chinese tourists.
This ongoing issue has not only affected Thailand’s tourism industry but has also prompted increased scrutiny from international governments, with some warning their citizens about the risks of traveling to Thailand, especially near border regions. Authorities in China, for example, have ramped up efforts to warn their citizens about fraudulent job scams in Southeast Asia, urging caution when considering employment opportunities abroad.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-there-so-many-scams-these-days-in-singapore">Why are there so many scams these days in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Scams have become increasingly common in Singapore due to a mix of technological advancements, social engineering tactics, and global crime syndicates taking advantage of unsuspecting victims. Here are some key reasons why scams are on the rise:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Increased Digital Connectivity
Singapore has one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world, making it easy for scammers to reach victims through messaging apps, emails, and social media. With almost everyone connected online, the opportunities for fraud have multiplied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rise of AI and Deepfake Technology
Scammers are now using AI-powered tools to create convincing deepfake videos, voice impersonations, and fake documents. This makes scams—especially those involving fake authorities, job offers, and investment schemes—much more believable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social Engineering and Psychological Manipulation
Many scams today rely on psychological tricks to create a sense of urgency, fear, or excitement. Whether it’s a fake delivery scam, a phishing email from “your bank,” or a romance scam, fraudsters exploit emotions to get victims to act without thinking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global Crime Syndicates Targeting Singapore
Many scams originate from overseas criminal syndicates, especially from countries like China, Myanmar, Cambodia, and the Philippines. These groups run large-scale scam operations, targeting Singaporeans with fake investment opportunities, phishing links, and e-commerce scams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easy Access to Personal Data
Data breaches and leaks have made personal information more accessible to scammers. With just a phone number, they can launch highly targeted scams, making fake calls from banks, government agencies, or delivery companies seem more legitimate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increase in Digital Payments and E-Commerce
The shift to cashless transactions has opened up new scam opportunities. Fake online stores, PayNow/PayLah! payment scams, and fraudulent QR codes have made it easier for scammers to steal money instantly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of Awareness and Cybersecurity Hygiene
Despite government efforts to raise awareness, some people still fall for scams because they don’t recognize warning signs. Clicking on suspicious links, sharing OTPs, or believing too-good-to-be-true job offers continue to be common mistakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weak Enforcement in Scam Hotspots
Many scammers operate from jurisdictions where law enforcement is weak or corrupt. This makes it difficult for Singaporean authorities to track them down or recover stolen money, allowing scams to continue at large scales.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work-From-Home and Online Job Scams
Since the pandemic, more people have been looking for online jobs, and scammers have taken full advantage. Fake job listings promising high pay for minimal work have scammed many Singaporeans into making upfront payments or laundering money unknowingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing Use of Telegram and WhatsApp for Illicit Activities
Scammers often use encrypted messaging apps like Telegram and WhatsApp to operate anonymously. Many scams involve fake investment groups, Ponzi schemes, and phishing attempts, making it harder for authorities to track down the perpetrators.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-type-of-scams-are-there-in-singapore">What type of scams are there in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Scams in Singapore come in many forms, evolving constantly to trick unsuspecting victims. Here are the most common types of scams you should watch out for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Phishing Scams
Scammers send fake emails, SMS, or WhatsApp messages pretending to be from banks, government agencies, or delivery companies. These messages often contain fake links that steal your personal data or banking details.
Example: A fake “DBS security alert” asking you to verify your account via a link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Banking &amp; OTP Scams
Victims receive calls or messages from fake bank officers asking for OTPs (One-Time Passwords) or login details. Once given, scammers drain the victim’s account.
Example: A scammer pretends to be from OCBC, claiming your account is compromised and needs OTP verification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>E-Commerce Scams
Fake online stores or sellers on platforms like Carousell, Shopee, and Facebook Marketplace trick buyers into paying for products that never arrive.
Example: A “cheap” iPhone listing on Carousell that disappears after payment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Job Scams
Scammers offer fake online jobs that promise easy money for simple tasks, like boosting social media likes or reviewing products. Victims are asked to transfer money upfront to unlock “higher commissions”—which never come.
Example: A Telegram job offer that claims you can earn “$300 a day” by liking YouTube videos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Love &amp; Romance Scams
Fraudsters build relationships with victims online, usually through dating apps or social media, and eventually ask for money due to a “family emergency” or “investment opportunity.”
Example: A Tinder match from overseas who suddenly needs money for a “business deal.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investment Scams
Scammers promise high returns with little risk through fake crypto, forex, or stock market investments. These scams often use fake testimonials and social media ads.
Example: A “crypto trading expert” on Instagram guarantees 500% returns if you send money to their “investment account.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fake Kidnapping Scams
Victims receive calls claiming a loved one has been kidnapped, demanding ransom money. Sometimes, scammers use AI voice deepfakes to make it more convincing.
Example: A scammer calls saying they have kidnapped your child, but your child is actually safe at school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fake Delivery Scams
You receive an SMS or WhatsApp message from “SingPost” or “DHL” saying your package is delayed. Clicking the link installs malware that steals your banking details.
Example: A fake “Your parcel is on hold, please update delivery info” message with a phishing link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government Impersonation Scams
Scammers pose as ICA, SPF, or MOM officers, claiming you have legal issues or visa problems. They demand money to “settle” the issue.
Example: A fake ICA officer calls, saying your residency status is at risk unless you transfer $5,000.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fake Loan Scams
Scammers pose as licensed moneylenders, offering quick loans with “low interest.” After victims apply, they are asked to pay upfront “processing fees” before disappearing.
Example: A fake loan ad on Facebook offering “instant approval” but requiring a deposit first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social Media &amp; Telegram Scams
Fraudsters impersonate your friends or join Telegram groups, promoting fake deals, jobs, or investments. Many scams involve Ponzi schemes where early investors get fake profits.
Example: A Telegram group claims to offer “guaranteed” profits through “US stock signals.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Charity &amp; Donation Scams
Fake charities ask for donations via WhatsApp, social media, or door-to-door visits, claiming to help disaster victims or sick children.
Example: A scammer pretends to raise funds for an “orphanage in Myanmar,” but the money goes straight into their pocket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rental Scams
Scammers post fake rental listings on PropertyGuru or Facebook, asking for deposits before viewing the unit. The “landlord” disappears after receiving payment.
Example: A too-good-to-be-true condo rental at $1,500/month that requires an upfront deposit to “secure” the place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WhatsApp Hijacking Scams
Fraudsters trick you into giving your WhatsApp verification code, then hijack your account to scam your contacts.
Example: A “friend” asks for your WhatsApp code, claiming they sent it to you by mistake.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ponzi &amp; Pyramid Schemes
These scams promise big returns if you recruit more people. Money flows up the chain, but eventually, the scheme collapses, leaving late joiners with nothing.
Example: A “crypto mining” program where you earn by recruiting others—until it vanishes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-watch-out-for-scams-in-singapore">How to watch out for scams in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Scammers are getting more sophisticated in Singapore, but you can protect yourself by staying alert and following these key precautions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Verify Before You Click
Never click on links from unknown SMS, emails, or WhatsApp messages.
If a bank, government agency, or delivery company contacts you, check their official website or call their hotline directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be Skeptical of Too-Good-To-Be-True Deals
If an online seller offers a luxury bag, iPhone, or rental unit at a ridiculously low price, it’s likely a scam.
Check reviews and seller ratings on platforms like Carousell and Facebook Marketplace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protect Your Banking Details
No bank or government agency will ask for your OTP, PIN, or login credentials over the phone or through email.
Use digital banking apps instead of SMS for transaction alerts, as scammers can spoof messages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Official Apps &amp; Platforms
Download ScamShield, an anti-scam app developed by the Singapore Police Force.
Avoid unofficial third-party payment methods—use secured platforms like PayNow, GrabPay, or credit cards for protection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watch Out for Fake Job Offers
If a Telegram or WhatsApp message offers “easy online jobs” with high returns, it’s likely a scam.
Real companies don’t ask for upfront payments or require you to “unlock higher commissions” by depositing money.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be Wary of “Friend” Messages Asking for Money
If a friend or family member suddenly asks for urgent money via WhatsApp, call them to verify.
Scammers hijack accounts and impersonate victims to trick their contacts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check Before Donating
Fake charities exploit disasters and tragedies to trick people into donating.
Verify with official sources like the Commissioner of Charities (charities.gov.sg).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid Investment &amp; Crypto Scams
High returns with “no risk” is always a scam.
Check the MAS Investor Alert List to see if a company is unregulated or flagged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be Cautious of Rental &amp; Property Deals
Never pay a deposit before viewing the property and meeting the agent in person.
Use licensed property agents listed on CEA’s (Council for Estate Agencies) website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Report &amp; Stay Updated
Follow ScamAlert.sg and SPF’s anti-scam advisories.
If you suspect a scam, report it to the Anti-Scam Hotline at 1800-722-6688 or through police e-services.</p>
