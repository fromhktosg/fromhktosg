I’ve always considered myself someone with a refined palate, and I’ve never quite found satisfaction in the recommendations from Google Maps, local Singaporeans, or local food blogs and YouTube channels. Therefore, I’ve made the decision to curate my own list for all you epicureans out there.</p>

<h4 id="some-ground-rules">Some ground rules</h4>

<p>As a reminder, this isn’t a fine dining list for 2 reasons - 1) it’s quite challenging to categorize the types of cuisine it covers, and 2) fine dining is never really a go-to option for food for anyone. I’ll share my list of fine dining recommendations at a later day. Additionally, we’ll exclude ‘Singaporean cuisine’ from this list as it deserves its own spotlight at another time. For certain cuisines, I don’t have a go-to choice as I don’t often have cravings for them. This includes Indian, Peranakan, Mala, etc., so they will also be omitted. These recommendations span across various price points. Keep in mind that this is my personal go-to list when I have specific cravings for a particular cuisine. If you have any recommendations, feel free to share them with me! I’d love to know your go-to places as well.</p>

<h5 id="western">Western</h5>

<p><u>Italian<u></u></u></p>

<p>Many italian restaurants are across the island. Most are tasty but way over price. Below are the ones that I find are value</p>

<ul>
  <li>No Menu ($$$): Experience authentic Italian cuisine complemented by excellent service and ambiance. True to its name, you can request dishes not listed on the menu. I personally recommend trying their seafood risotto and lobster ravioli.</li>
  <li>Publico ($$): A vibrant al fresco restaurant situated in the heart of Robertson Quay, perfect for brunch enthusiasts. I’m a fan of their shakshuka and pasta dishes. It’s an ideal spot for a mid-day drink.</li>
  <li>Pasta Bar ($$$): Indulge in high-quality, fresh pasta dishes in the heart of the city. This is my top choice for seafood pasta in Singapore, thanks to their exceptionally fresh ingredients and al dente pasta</li>
  <li>Ristorante Takada ($$$): Italian Japanese fusion. High value</li>
</ul>

      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Ristorante Takada’s signature uni pasta - incredible umami</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><u>Mediterranean<u></u></u></p>

<p>Mediterranean is not the most common in Singapore but for the establishments below, they execute on their respective dishes well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blu Kouzina ($$$): Renowned Mediterranean restaurant in Singapore known for its authentic dishes inspired by Greece, Turkey, and Lebanon. They emphasize high-quality ingredients sourced from Greece, offering a warm and inviting dining experience. I love their EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) - it’s pretty much on every dish. Order their baked halloumi cheese too - it’s divine</li>
  <li>Bakalaki Greek Taverna ($$$): Less of a vibe compared to Blu Kouzina, but serves up incredible gyros and souvlakis</li>
</ul>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Feta salad with EVOO - an evergreen classic</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><u>Spanish<u></u></u></p>

<p>Similar to Mediterranean cuisine, Spanish food isn’t common in Singapore. The two below are absolute standouts for me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>FOC ($$$): One’s in sentosa whilst the other’s near boat quay. Master of the Josper grill. Try their Iberian pork jowl and the Josper grilled spanish octopus. Their desserts are not to be discounted.</li>
  <li>Olivia ($$$): Known for their blue cheese basque cheesecake and croquettes. Intimate and straight to the point Spanish food that transports you back to Barcelona</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Burgers<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are plenty of burger places in Singapore including popular chains. Shake shack has to be a shout out here because it is decent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Honbo ($$): Originally from Hong Kong and recently opened in Singapore. They serve up amazing smash patties with a fluffy potato milk bun, with their Double Gold American beef coming from Wisconsin</li>
  <li>Three buns ($$): As a part of the Potato Head Club, Three Buns is a popular burger joint known for its creative and delicious beef burgers. While it may not be the most budget-friendly option, the indulgent and delectable offerings make it a worthwhile culinary experience</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Steakhouse<u></u></u></p>

<p>Multiple restaurants serve steak in Singapore, but not a lot of them are steakhouses. I wouldn’t exactly call Burnt Ends a steakhouse given it does have a michelin star and is more relevated, but their steak is a definite highlight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Burnt ends (\(\)): Famous for its wood-fired cooking techniques and innovative dishes. Their signature item, the Burnt Ends Sanger, is a must-try—a flavorful sandwich featuring smoked meats and homemade pickles, served on a potato roll. Order a steak even if it’s expensive. Don’t bother with their bakery</li>
  <li>Wolfgangs (\(\)): The best steakhouse I’ve been that’s not in South America. Incredibly pricey but their steaks are perfectly charred and grilled. Portions are extremely generous. A perfect pick for a marquee celebration</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pizza<u></u></u></p>

<p>Singapore’s pizza scene is slowly growing, with a mix of American and Italian chains popping up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wild Child ($$): One of the best Neapolitan pizzas in Singapore. The dough is fluffy with a gorgeous amount of chewiness, complemented by quality ingredients. It’s known for its signature crack sauce that adds a burst of flavour to every pizza.</li>
  <li>Extra Virgin Pizza ($$): Less of a vibe than Wild Child, but there’s no doubt that their pizzas are divine. Their crusts are always beautifully charred and their innovative toppings amalgamate finely with the base</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="asian">Asian</h5>

<p><u>Taiwanese<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are quite a few Taiwanese-style restaurants, but not a lot of authentic Taiwanese food that is at the price point that it should be in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Isshin Machi ($$): My go-to Taiwanese restaurant in Singapore is Isshin Machi, with multiple locations across the island. I particularly adore their pork chop fried rice (which gives Din Tai Fung a run for its money) and their refreshing winter melon tea (not to sweet, just mellow)</li>
  <li>Abundance ($$): My old neighbourhood haunt that is massively underrated. Their gua baos, dumplings and bacon cabbage make for a perfect late night meal</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Cantonese / Dim sum<u></u></u></p>

<p>Hailing from Hong Kong, there is a long list of restaurants / dining establishments I default to. One I have to shout out is Canton Paradise. Those chain stores are decent. More on specific dim sum options in <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/dimsum/">my previous article</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legendary HK ($$): My default cha chaan teng. Huge variety of options, authentic cantonese flavours and very affordable. Their congee is divine and fluffy unlike Singaporean / Taiwanese congee</li>
  <li>So good ($$): So good has a couple of chains across the island, and whilst I prefer Legendary as my #1 cantonese haunt, So Good comes in as a close second. I’m a sucker for their breakfast and afternoon tea</li>
  <li>Wah lok: ($$) Best dim sum in SG. They don’t skimp on the ingredients, so expect plump siu mais and shrimp dumplings. Great value for money given the restaurant is situated at the Carlton hotel</li>
  <li>Fook kin ($$): Best cantonese roast that’s not fine dining or a preppy cantonese restaurant. Not 100% authentic cantonese cha siu (more of a malaysian style instead) but does a terrific job in delivering charred, tender roast meat</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Japanese<u></u></u></p>

<p>This is a weird one. There are plenty of fantastic japanese restaurants in Singapore at all price points. Unlike other cuisines, I can’t bring myself to eat high end Japanese food in Singapore as they are too criminally priced. Hence, the below are some of my more comfortable options.</p>

<p>The sushi bar: My go-to for chirashi bowls. The Sushi bar serves up generous portions at a very respectable price point. Feel free to ask them to swap out specific cuts of fish if you prefer others - I always ask for more Salmon instead of swordfish
Omote: Similar to the Sushi Bar, Omote serves up comfort japanese food. They have a branch in City Hall now so if I’m near there versus Orchard where The Sushi Bar is, I’ll pop in for a meal
Sushiro: ‘Fun’ conveyor belt sushi. Don’t hate on my recommendation but Sushiro is delightfully pleasant, with a frequent rotating menu to highlight seasonal cuts
Brothers ramen: A dining hall for many Japanese expats in Singapore. I love how clean their broth is and their ramen has the perfect amount of spring in it</p>

<p><u>Korean<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are plenty of korean food places along the Tanjong Pagar stretch, and they are all of impressive qualities. To highlight a few -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wang dae bak: Korean BBQ masterclass on top of a traditional grill. Book ahead of time as it always get filled</li>
  <li>SBCD tofu house: For hearty Sundubu jigae. Their tofu is made-in-house and is simple yet delicious</li>
  <li>Obba Jajang: MY go-to for jjajangmyeon and jjampong. Their banchan is average but I love their noodles (springy, chewy, slurpy)</li>
  <li>Magal: Versatile restaurant, with delicious BBQ options as well as jigaes (stew). Don’t skip out on their cockles rice and their gamjatang (pork bone stew)</li>
</ul>

Let’s take a delightful journey through the history and cultural impact of this beloved café, where tradition meets the aromatic allure of freshly brewed coffee. Then, I’ll reveal my go-to options at this establishment. Let’s get started.
History of toast box
Founding Roots:
Conceived by the visionary minds at BreadTalk Group, Toast Box emerged with a mission to recreate the ambiance and flavors of the traditional kopitiams that were once the heartbeat of Singapore. Unlike Ya Kun / Yakun toast which started as a coffee stall in 1944, Toast Box is a more recent creation. The first Toast Box café opened its doors in 2005, breathing life into a concept that would soon become synonymous with nostalgic charm and authentic Singaporean breakfast. Well-played BreadTalk Group.
What sets Toast Box apart is its commitment to preserving the rich heritage of local coffee culture. Stepping into a Toast Box outlet is like stepping back in time, with its retro décor and the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee filling the air. The café’s design reflects the aesthetics of traditional kopitiams, creating a nostalgic haven for locals and a delightful discovery for tourists.
Fueled by the warmth of its kopi and the irresistible aroma of its toasts, Toast Box quickly gained popularity. Its success transcended the borders of Singapore, leading to international expansion. Today, Toast Box is not just a local gem but also an ambassador of Singaporean breakfast culture, with outlets in various international locations.
Toast Box has played a pivotal role in fostering an appreciation for Singapore’s coffee culture. It has become more than just a place to savor a cup of kopi; it’s a cultural touchstone where locals gather for a taste of tradition, and tourists seek an authentic experience.
While Toast Box remains deeply rooted in tradition, it has not shied away from evolution. The café has adapted to changing consumer preferences, introducing new menu items without compromising the authenticity that defines its identity. It strikes a delicate balance between preserving the past and embracing the present.
Let’s dive into some of Toast box’s signatures</p>
<ol>
  <li>Kaya Toast: A Symphony of Simplicity
Let’s start our gastronomic expedition with the iconic Kaya Toast, a dish that embodies simplicity and flavor. The magic begins with perfectly toasted bread, generously layered with the heavenly combination of kaya (coconut and egg jam) and a velvety slab of butter. The result? A crispy, warm delight that hugs your senses and sets the perfect tone for the day.</li>

  <li>Nasi Lemak: An Ode to Local Flavors
For those craving a taste of local flair, the Nasi Lemak at Toast Box is a gastronomic masterpiece. Fragrant coconut rice, crispy anchovies, spicy sambal, and a perfectly fried egg – each element plays a role in creating a flavor symphony that celebrates the diverse and vibrant tapestry of Singaporean cuisine.</li>
  <li>Teh Tarik: Liquid Gold for Your Palate
No visit to Toast Box is complete without indulging in Teh Tarik. This pulled milk tea, sweetened to perfection and adorned with frothy goodness, is liquid gold in a cup. It’s not just a beverage; it’s a comforting companion to your toasty adventures, providing a delightful balance to the array of flavors on your plate.</li>
  <li>Curry Chicken with Rice:
Serving up a symphony of spices, Toast Box’s Curry Chicken with Rice is a culinary masterpiece that tantalizes the taste buds. This aromatic dish features tender chicken pieces bathed in a rich and flavorful curry sauce, served alongside fragrant jasmine rice.

This classic dish pays homage to the culinary traditions of Hainanese cuisine, presenting succulent pork chops marinated to perfection and deep-fried to a golden crisp. Each bite is a delightful crunch of nostalgia, reminiscent of the beloved flavors from the past. Served with a side of fragrant rice, this dish is a testament to the enduring appeal of time-honored recipes.</li>
  <li>Claypot Hokkien Prawn Mee:
For seafood enthusiasts, Toast Box introduces a delectable rendition of the iconic Claypot Hokkien Prawn Mee. This dish is a harmonious blend of thick yellow noodles, succulent prawns, and a rich, flavorful broth infused with the essence of the sea. Cooked to perfection in a claypot, the noodles absorb the savory goodness, creating a delightful medley of textures and tastes. With its hearty portions and tantalizing aroma, this dish is a celebration of Singapore’s culinary diversity and a must-try for those craving a seafood-infused delight.
Toast box also serves desserts and Kopi (local Nanyang coffee). I’m not really into either so I can’t really comment on it.

Happy toasting, dear food connoisseurs! 🍞✨</li>

But let’s face it, in this age of technological marvels, even the simplest tasks have evolved. Many of us have embraced the convenience of online grocery shopping, making our lives even more hassle-free. Let’s embark on a journey to uncover the top online grocery options that Singapore has to offer for all us lazy people.</p>

<h4 id="why-shop-for-groceries-online">Why shop for groceries online?</h4>

<p>TL;DR - we’re lazy. To expand -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convenience: Shop from the comfort of your home, avoiding the need to travel to physical stores, stand in lines, or carry heavy bags. Many online grocery stores operate 24/7, providing the flexibility to shop whenever it’s most convenient for you, whether that’s early in the morning or late at night</li>
  <li>Time-saving: Quickly browse and select items, eliminating the need for a time-consuming trip to the store</li>
  <li>Price comparison: Compare prices easily across different brands and products, helping you find the best deals and discounts</li>
  <li>Subscription services: Schedule recurring deliveries for essential items, ensuring you never run out of household staples</li>

<p>Yes and no. It really depends on the quantity of goods you are purchasing. Online platforms usually have discount codes and incentivize bulk buying. However, you have to factor in whether delivery fees are high (if not waived at all).</p>

<h4 id="cons-of-online-grocery-shopping">Cons of online grocery shopping</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Quality and Freshness: Some individuals prefer to select their own fresh produce and items with a specific expiration date in physical stores to ensure quality. When shopping online, you are relying on the shopper’s judgment.</li>

While marriage remains a vital aspect of Singaporean culture, it’s worth examining the trends and factors that have shaped the current landscape. Heads-up, marriage is not for everyone. Some even think it’s a scam. This isn’t an article about why you should or should not get married. By all means, do whatever that works for you. However, we will discuss how marriage has been shifting in Singapore, as well as what you should look out for when taking your wedding photos. In that regard, we are here to make sure you don’t get scammed by pesky wedding photographers.</p>

<h4 id="lets-begin-with-the-shifts-in-the-marriage-landscape">Let’s begin with the shifts in the marriage landscape</h4>

<p>There has been a changing attitude towards marriage in Singapore, Marriage has traditionally been viewed as a significant life milestone in Singapore, often symbolizing stability and commitment. However, contemporary attitudes towards marriage have evolved. Many young Singaporeans are choosing to delay marriage to focus on their careers, personal growth, and financial stability. The emphasis is now on marrying for love and compatibility rather than societal expectations. Some beginning thoughts on what else is driving the shift and other phenomena that have arose from this -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declining marriage rates: Singapore has witnessed a decline in marriage rates over the past decade. Factors such as increasing educational attainment, financial independence, and changing gender roles have contributed to this trend. People are prioritizing higher education and career advancement before considering marriage, resulting in later unions</li>
  <li>Cohabitation and unmarried parenthood: Cohabitation is becoming increasingly common in Singapore. Couples are choosing to live together and build their lives before formalizing their relationships through marriage. Additionally, the stigma surrounding unmarried parenthood has diminished, with more couples choosing to start families without traditional marriage</li>
  <li>Rising age at first marriage:The average age at which Singaporeans get married has risen steadily. Many are tying the knot in their late twenties or early thirties, compared to earlier generations who often married in their early twenties. This shift is driven by the pursuit of personal goals and financial stability before taking on the responsibilities of marriage</li>
  <li>Multicultural marriages: Singapore’s multicultural society has led to an increase in intercultural and cross-border marriages. Couples from different cultural backgrounds or nationalities are coming together, enriching the country’s cultural tapestry. These marriages often involve navigating unique challenges, such as cultural differences and immigration processes
Government initiatives: The Singaporean government has recognized the evolving dynamics of marriage and family life. Policies and initiatives, such as the Marriage and Parenthood Package, aim to support couples in building strong families. These initiatives include financial incentives, parental leave, and flexible work arrangements to encourage marriage and parenthood</li>
  <li>Embracing diversity: Singapore’s evolving attitudes towards marriage reflect a broader global trend of embracing diversity in relationships and family structures. While traditional marriages remain essential, the country’s openness to various relationship choices (although LGBT marriages are still not recognized) reflects a more inclusive and accepting society.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="should-i-have-a-wedding-or-should-i-just-rom">Should I have a wedding or should I just ROM?</h4>

<p>This is an increasingly common question amongst the younger generation. ROM stands for registration of marriage (aka signing  marriage papers). For those who have a wedding, most ROM during the wedding though some ROM prior the wedding itself. There are several reasons why an increasing number of people in Singapore are opting not to have traditional weddings and just opting for ROM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cost: Weddings are expensive. Many couples find that the cost of hosting a wedding, which includes venue rental, catering, decor, and other expenses, can be a significant financial burden. As a result, some couples choose to allocate their resources differently, perhaps for a house, travel, or other financial goals</li>
  <li>Lifestyle choices: Some couples prefer to embrace a simpler and more minimalist lifestyle. They may opt for smaller, more intimate gatherings or choose alternative ways to celebrate their union that align with their values. Smaller, intimate gatherings with close family and friends are becoming increasingly popular. Couples often find that these smaller events are more meaningful and allow for deeper connections with their loved ones.</li>
  <li>Parents have less say: Parents have less influence nowadays when it comes to weddings. Weddings have traditionally been an occasion for parents to showcase and brag about their children. However, with a gradual decline in parental control over their offspring and more relaxed expectations regarding filial piety, parents find themselves with diminishing authority in orchestrating elaborate weddings</li>
  <li>Time Constraints: Planning a traditional wedding can be a time-consuming endeavor. In today’s fast-paced world, with demanding work schedules and various commitments, couples often find themselves strapped for time when it comes to organizing and carrying out a wedding. This situation often prompts them to opt for simpler alternatives. I’ve heard from numerous friends who, in hindsight, express a desire for a smaller-scale wedding or even forgo the idea of a wedding altogether. The stress associated with wedding planning, they recount, detracted from their ability to fully enjoy their own special day</li>
  <li>Cultural Shifts: Changing cultural norms and values can influence marriage choices. As societal attitudes evolve, there is less pressure to conform to traditional wedding expectations, allowing couples more flexibility in how they choose to celebrate their union</li>
  <li>COVID-19 Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted wedding plans for many couples. Restrictions on gatherings and health concerns have led some to postpone or downsize their weddings, while others have chosen to have small, intimate ceremonies. COVID officially showed the world that smaller weddings are ok!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whats-the-deal-with-destination-weddings">What’s the deal with destination weddings?</h4>

<p>Singaporeans often choose beautiful and picturesque destinations for their destination weddings. Here’s why you would do one:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scenic and unique locations: Destination weddings allow couples to tie the knot in picturesque and unique settings. From beachfront ceremonies to historic castles or tropical islands, the choice of location can be stunning and unforgettable</li>
  <li>Intimate gatherings: Many couples prefer smaller, more intimate weddings with only close family and friends. Destination weddings naturally limit the guest list, creating a more personal and meaningful experience. Don’t like an aunt or uncle? A destination wedding helps resolve this</li>
  <li>Built-In Honeymoon: Destination weddings often double as a honeymoon. Couples can seamlessly transition from the wedding festivities to their honeymoon, saving both time and money</li>
  <li>Neutral location: If the couple comes from different cultural backgrounds or has family in different locations, a destination wedding can be a way to bring everyone together and celebrate in a neutral location</li>
  <li>Reduced Stress: Destination wedding packages offered by resorts and venues often include wedding planning services. This can significantly reduce the stress associated with planning a traditional wedding</li>
  <li>Cost-Effective: In some cases, destination weddings can be more cost-effective than traditional weddings, especially when considering guest numbers and all-inclusive packages</li>
  <li>Symbolic Locations: Sometimes, couples choose a destination with personal significance, such as where they met or a place they’ve always dreamed of visiting</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some popular destination wedding locations favored by couples from Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bali, Indonesia: Bali is a top choice for destination weddings due to its stunning beaches, lush landscapes, and vibrant culture. Couples can exchange vows overlooking the Indian Ocean or in lush tropical gardens. Bali offers a range of wedding venues, from luxury resorts to private villas</li>
  <li>Phuket, Thailand: Phuket’s pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and luxurious resorts make it a sought-after destination for  weddings. Couples can have a beachfront ceremony or choose from numerous scenic venues. Thailand’s warm hospitality and exotic charm add to the appeal</li>
  <li>Santorini, Greece: Santorini’s iconic white-washed buildings, dramatic cliffs, and breathtaking sunsets create a romantic backdrop for weddings. Many couples opt for intimate ceremonies overlooking the caldera or in charming chapels</li>
  <li>Maldives: The Maldives offers a dreamy setting for beachfront weddings. Overwater bungalows, turquoise waters, and coral reefs make it a paradise for couples seeking a romantic escape and a unique wedding experience. Of course, it’s extremely expensive too</li>
  <li>Da Nang, Vietnam: A top choice given its proximity to Singapore alongside a good value for money. You’ll get amazing food and beaches similar to Bali, at a better cost</li>
</ul>

<p>These destination wedding locations offer a blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and romantic charm, making them popular choices for couples looking to create memorable and unique wedding experiences. Keep in mind that wedding planning for international destinations may involve additional logistical considerations, so it’s essential to plan ahead. I’ve been to weddings in Indonesia, Vietnam and Korea. They were all gorgeous in their own way.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-wedding-photos-so-expensive-in-singapore">Why are wedding photos so expensive in Singapore?</h4>

<p>Wedding photographs play an integral role in capturing the essence of the wedding experience. Different individuals opt for various approaches when it comes to photography. Some arrange pre-wedding photoshoots, while others focus on capturing moments on the wedding day itself. Some even choose to document their post-wedding moments. Moreover, there are options for both indoor and outdoor photoshoots, catering to individual preferences. Remarkably, the field of wedding photography has evolved into a thriving industry.</p>

<p>Wedding photography in Singapore can be relatively expensive for several reasons, and some couples opt to have their wedding photos taken abroad for cost savings and unique experiences. Let me tell you - this is the way to go. Here’s why wedding photography in Singapore can be costly and why couples consider overseas options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High Cost of Living: Singapore is known for its high cost of living, which affects various services, including wedding photography. Photographers have to cover their living expenses, equipment costs, and other overheads, leading to higher rates. This is the main reason</li>
  <li>Demand and Competition: Singapore’s wedding industry is highly competitive, with many couples vying for the best services. High demand often leads to photographers charging premium rates for their services. I would say not all photographers are quality, but given the limited supply in Singapore, rates are boosted up</li>
  <li>Customization and Packages: Photographers often offer customizable packages to meet the unique needs of each couple. These packages may include engagement sessions, pre-wedding shoots, and various album options, adding to the overall cost. Guess what? Singaporeans are needy. From the photographers I have spoken with, many said that Singaporean couples ask for more customizations versus couples of other backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-do-you-avoid-wedding-photo-traps">How do you avoid wedding photo traps?</h4>

<p>Wedding photography selection can be distressing and financially damaging. The industry is filled with red flags and predatory sales tactics. Here are some wedding photo scams to watch out for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bait-and-Switch: A photographer showcases impressive work online, but when hired, provides subpar quality photos. They may even send a different photographer to the wedding</li>
  <li>Payment Upfront: Scammers may insist on full payment or a significant deposit before the wedding day, then disappear or provide substandard services. Legitimate photographers typically require a deposit, but be cautious if the request seems excessive</li>
  <li>No Contract: A reputable photographer will always provide a detailed contract outlining services, pricing, and terms. Avoid photographers who refuse to provide or sign a contract</li>
  <li>Hidden Fees and Payment Methods: The biggest one to watch out for. Some dishonest photographers may lure clients with seemingly low upfront prices but later add hidden fees for services like editing, album creation, buying ampoules or extra hours. Be sure to clarify all potential additional costs upfront and include them in the contract to avoid surprises</li>
  <li>Payment Methods: Scammers might encourage cash payments to avoid leaving a financial trail. This can be risky because it makes it difficult to track and dispute payments if there are issues with the service. Always choose secure payment methods like credit cards, checks, or online transfers, which provide records and some level of protection against fraud</li>
  <li>Individual Photo Sales: Be cautious if the photographer insists on selling individual photos separately after the event. This can result in significantly higher costs than initially quoted. Ideally, your contract should include all agreed-upon services and the delivery of a complete set of edited photos</li>
  <li>Pressure Sales Tactics: Be wary of photographers who use high-pressure sales tactics or make unrealistic promises to secure your business</li>
  <li>Limited-Time Offers: Promising exclusive discounts or offers that are only available if you make an immediate decision</li>
</ul>

<p>Artiz Studio serves as a quintessential example of a questionable business practice. The studio lacks price transparency, often springing additional photo costs on unsuspecting customers. Their sales tactics can be aggressive, employing hard-sell techniques, and sometimes resorting to demeaning competitors. They heavily promote a supposed “Korean vibe” while concealing hidden costs that can catch customers off guard. They initially presented a price but later informed us of limited-time packages that required an immediate decision on that same day. While the photography displayed in this studio appeared beautiful, their aggressive sales tactics discouraged us from considering further transactions with them. It is advisable to steer clear of this establishment. It’s worth noting that several other photography studios employ similar practices, so it’s essential to be prepared for their direct approach.</p>

<p>To avoid falling victim to wedding photo scams:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research photographers thoroughly, read reviews, and ask for references</li>
  <li>Meet with potential photographers in person or via video call to assess their professionalism</li>
  <li>Request a detailed contract that outlines all services, fees, and terms</li>
  <li>Pay using secure methods, such as credit cards, which offer some protection against fraud</li>
  <li>Trust your instincts. If something doesn’t feel right, consider other options. Cross-reference online in all review sites and social media platforms. People will speak up if they feel their experience was subpar</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s crucial to exercise caution and due diligence when hiring a wedding photographer to ensure that your special day is captured beautifully and without any unpleasant surprises.</p>

Whilst it isn’t a country club, the establishment in its grandeur and luxury sure felt like one. Having personally experienced the allure of country clubs while being part of one in Hong Kong, I was naturally drawn to explore what Singapore’s country clubs have to offer. Today, we’ll unpack a little about country clubs, including the verdant landscapes and luxurious amenities and weighing the question on everyone’s mind: Are they worth it? Join me as we unravel the world of Singaporean country clubs and discover whether these exclusive enclaves truly live up to their reputation.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-5-cs-that-all-singaporeans-revere">What are the 5 C’s that all Singaporeans revere?</h4>

<p>In the realm of Singaporean culture and lifestyle, the “5 Cs” have long held a special place. Historically symbolizing cash, car, credit card, condominium and country club, these markers of affluence have shaped aspirations and defined success for generations of Singaporeans. These five Cs are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash: Refers to the pursuit of wealth and financial success</li>
  <li>Car: Singapore’s car prices are among the highest in the world due to significant taxes and fees, making car ownership a status symbol</li>
  <li>Credit Card: Self-explanatory, although getting a credit card was much more difficult a generation back</li>
  <li>Condo: Owned private real estate versus government housing (HDBs) is much more valuable (and comfortable)</li>
  <li>Country Club: Joining an exclusive country club is considered a symbol of prestige</li>
</ul>

<p>While the concept of the five C’s is often taken lightly, many Singaporeans adhere to its philosophy and aspire to ‘collect them all.’</p>

<h4 id="how-did-country-clubs-come-about-in-singapore">How did country clubs come about in Singapore?</h4>

<p>The roots of country clubs can be traced back to a time when colonial influences and British traditions shaped Singapore’s landscape. These clubs emerged as enclaves where colonial expatriates gathered to escape the tropical heat, indulge in recreational activities, and foster a sense of community. Over the decades, these exclusive retreats have evolved to become more diverse, catering to the changing demographics and interests of Singapore’s populace. However, this is also the reason why many country clubs are named after particular countries i.e. The American Club.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-you-join-a-country-club">Why should you join a country club?</h4>

<p>During my membership at a country club in Hong Kong, I dedicated the majority of my time to utilizing their tennis facilities, spending six days a week there for training. In fact, the country club became my third most frequently visited location, following my school and home. A good amount of my friends hung out there too. Looking back, I loved being part of that community. Here’s why there’s merit in joining a country club -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sanctuary lifestyle: At their core, country clubs in Singapore serve as sanctuaries, offering members an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban living. They are nestled amidst lush greenery, providing an oasis of tranquility where one can reconnect with nature, unwind, and recharge. It’s a place where time seems to slow down, and the stresses of daily life fade into the background</li>
  <li>Facilities: One of the defining features of country clubs is their extensive range of recreational facilities. While golf courses remain a hallmark, these clubs have diversified to include tennis courts, swimming pools, gyms, and even equestrian facilities. This diversity ensures that members of all ages can find activities that cater to their interests and fitness levels</li>
  <li>Fine dining: From casual poolside snacks to elegant fine dining experiences, these clubs boast a variety of dining options. Members can savor an array of cuisines and delight in gastronomic adventures, often accompanied by scenic views of the club’s sprawling grounds</li>
  <li>Networking: Beyond leisure and sports, country clubs play a pivotal role as social hubs. They provide a platform for networking and building relationships among individuals from diverse backgrounds. Memberships often span generations, creating a sense of community and continuity that extends beyond the club’s facilities</li>
  <li>Family activities: Many country clubs recognize the importance of family bonding. They offer family-friendly amenities, including children’s play areas, kid-focused activities, and even educational programs. These clubs become places where generations come together to create lasting memories</li>
  <li>Exclusive Events and Entertainment: Country clubs often host exclusive events, including gala dinners, themed parties, and cultural celebrations. These gatherings provide members with opportunities to socialize and enjoy unique entertainment experiences</li>
  <li>Prestige and Status: Joining a prestigious country club can enhance one’s social status and reputation, as these clubs are often associated with affluence and success</li>
  <li>Legacy and Tradition: Some members value the sense of tradition and heritage associated with country clubs. Membership often spans generations, creating a sense of continuity and belonging</li>

Associate memberships are often available to family members of full members or individuals who do not meet the criteria for full membership.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="so-are-country-clubs-worth-it">So are country clubs worth it?</h4>

<p>It depends. Ultimately, it’s often more about status, but if you spend a significant amount of time there and a country club offers a place for your children to socialize, it can be justifiable.</p>

<p>Honestly, the options above sound pretty sound lame compared to a country club, but there’s nothing wrong with being more frugal and responsible. Ultimately, a country club provides its own merits and it’s understandable that Singaporeans want to strive to be part of one. I know I will.

Having personally experienced the allure of country clubs while being part of one in Hong Kong, I was naturally drawn to explore what Singapore’s country clubs have to offer. Today, we’ll unpack a little about country clubs, including the verdant landscapes and luxurious amenities and weighing the question on everyone’s mind: Are they worth it?

Interestingly, most of my peers in Hong Kong, as well as my friends in Singapore, continue to live in their family homes if they remained in the same country post college graduation. Even in the case of marriage, a significant percentage of them choose to reside with their families unless they have accumulated enough resources to afford their own place. This trend is notably common in these two Asian countries, in contrast to the United States. Today, we’ll delve into the phenomenon of adults living with their parents and explore its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<h4 id="why-do-singaporeans-live-with-their-parents">Why do Singaporeans live with their parents?</h4>

<p>An estimated 97% of unmarried individuals between the ages of 15 and 34 lived with their parents in 2013. Whilst this number is from ten years ago, it’s still unfathomable for me to comprehend why someone would loiter at home for such a lengthy time frame. It’s a fascinating aspect of Singapore culture that often raises eyebrows among our international friends. Let’s unpack the reasons behind this unique lifestyle choice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cost of living
Let’s not sugarcoat it; living in Singapore can burn a hole in your pocket. With sky-high property prices and rent that can make your eyes water, it’s no wonder that many young adults opt to bunk with mum and dad. This financial strategy lets us save our hard-earned cash for other life goals, like furthering our education, kick-starting our careers, or exploring the world. This is the reason I hear the most from my local friends. It makes sense but also strips away from an independent lifestyle that can be priceless. We’ll touch on this later on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Filial piety and family values
Now, here’s where it gets heartwarming. Rooted in Confucian values, it’s all about respecting and caring for our parents, especially as they grow older. Living under the same roof is seen as a tangible way to show love and respect. It’s like a warm, perpetual family hug that keeps family bonds strong. However, I see staying at home as a poor reason for filial piety, especially amongst the younger generation. You can still be taking care of your parents without living with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A built-in support system
Who doesn’t love a solid support system? Living with family means you’ve got a tribe to rely on—be it for sage advice, a hand with chores, or simply some good old-fashioned company. In fact, many of us owe our sanity to this network of support. Grandparents often join in on the fun, pitching in with childcare duties and adding extra layers of love to the mix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practicality and convenience
Living at home is the epitome of convenience. No more worries about grocery shopping, cooking, or laundry—parents often take the reins. This means more time and energy to dedicate to careers and personal growth. Plus, parents are usually more than happy to lend a helping hand—whether it’s whipping up breakfast or offering a ride to work. I hate this reason personally given it just sounds like freeloading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of pressure to move out
Unlike in some Western cultures, where moving out is the badge of adulthood, Singaporeans face zero societal pressure to vacate the family nest. In fact, it’s perfectly normal, widely accepted, and definitely no reason to raise an eyebrow. This is something that is changing in Singapore’s societal fabric, and something I want all Singaporeans to challenge.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it, folks! Living with parents in Singapore is about more than just saving a few bucks; it’s a reflection of our rich cultural values of filial piety, strong family bonds, and unwavering support. Whether it’s for financial stability, emotional connection, or the sheer joy of sharing life’s moments with loved ones, bunking with Mom and Dad is a lifestyle choice that’s here to stay.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-deal-with-multi-generational-living">What’s the deal with multi-generational living?</h4>

<p>In many Singaporean families, it’s common for several generations to reside under one roof, even when parents are old and have children of their own. In fact, the number of resident households increased from 1,145,900 households in 2010 to 1,372,600 households in 2020. Not to go too much into this topic, but root causes of filial piety, economic considerations and practical benefits contribute to such phenomenon.</p>

<h4 id="the-flip-side-and-the-challenges-that-come-with-staying-at-home">The flip side and the challenges that come with staying at home</h4>

<p>Between 1990 and 2020 the number of those under 35 who lived alone or with non-family members grew from 33,400 to 51,300 (The economist). Additionally, local real estate portal PropertyGuru showed seven in 10 respondents between the ages of 22 and 39 were considering moving out. This shows the growing trend of Singaporeans leaving home. Let’s unpack the reasons why.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Space Squeeze
Singapore is a tiny red dot on the map, and boy, my friends feel it when they’re all cozying up in the same apartment. With property prices soaring higher than our aspirations, limited living space can be a real buzzkill. Forget personal space; it’s more like “Can I please have any space?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independence
Living with your parents well into adulthood can make it tough to carve out your own identity. While other twenty- and thirty-somethings around the world are out there solo-traveling, building their empires, or even just decorating their own pads, we might feel like we’re in a bit of a holding pattern. I feel maximum 25 years old is the age where one should move out. This way, it feels like you can structure life to your own accord.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dating dilemmas
Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: dating. In a city where the dating game is already challenging, explaining that you live with Mom and Dad can add an extra layer of complexity. It’s like a rite of passage—eventually, we all hope to have a place to call our own for those romantic rendezvous. We covered dating in a previous article - it’s much better to have your own abode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parental power
Ah, the classic “When are you getting married?” and “Why aren’t you home yet?” questions that can drive us up the wall. Living under the same roof might mean dealing with a bit more parental pester power than you’d like. They mean well, but sometimes, you just need your own space to breathe. Leaving home equates to being in control of your own life. No monetary ties, no decisions influenced by parents if you don’t want their opinions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The boomerang effect
It’s all fun and games until you decide it’s time to spread your wings and fly. But what if you’ve been under your parents’ roof for so long that you’ve forgotten how to adult on your own? The boomerang effect—a return to the nest after an attempt at independence—can be a humbling experience, to say the least. Leaving your parent’s roof doesn’t mean you won’t come back or won’t take care of them either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="additional-pull-factors-of-leaving-home">Additional pull factors of leaving home</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing number of co-living spaces
Co-living spaces have gained popularity worldwide, offering an affordable, community-oriented housing solution. Singapore could promote the development of such spaces designed for young adults. These environments foster independence while providing essential amenities and a built-in support system. Think Hmlet in Singapore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Career opportunities beyond Singapore
Sometimes, the best way to encourage independence is to expand horizons. Singaporean companies and the government can promote overseas work opportunities, internships, or exchange programs. These experiences not only help young adults gain independence but also broaden their perspectives. Singapore is a huge bubble, hence I always encourage locals here to go abroad if their means can afford it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changing mindsets
There is a shifting societal norm and a growing emphasis on independence, which will lead to a healthier peer pressure to move out of one’s parental home.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Living with your parents as an adult in Singapore can be a double-edged sword. While it offers financial stability, emotional closeness, and an unwavering support system, it also comes with space constraints, identity challenges, and a few extra dating hurdles. But hey, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer here. Whether you’re nesting with Mom and Dad or spreading your wings into the unknown, the important thing is finding what works for you.</p>

Both the tech and banking sectors are experiencing layoffs, and start-ups are not as actively hiring, leading to an abundance of talent in the market competing for a limited number of job openings. Singapore’s job search landscape is in this sticky state. However if we looked a couple years back, Singapore attracted a plethora of international talent given its robust economy, diverse industries, and business-friendly atmosphere. In our guide today, we’ll take a deep dive into the key industries, top companies, sought-after roles, and vital employment regulations you must navigate while pursuing your career aspirations in Singapore. Additionally, I’ll share some insights of the best way of landing a job in Singapore if you are currently abroad. I’ll also share some insights from my own job hunt experience in a later post, along with strategies you can employ to carve your path to success.</p>

<h4 id="the-appeal-of-singapore-why-work-here">The appeal of Singapore: Why work here?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Economic prosperity and business friendliness: Singapore’s unwavering <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/stablenation/">economic stability</a> and flourishing industries make it a magnet for businesses. The city-state’s pro-business policies, minimal taxes, and robust infrastructure create an ideal environment for local and international enterprises alike.</li>
  <li>Strategic geographic hub: Nestled at the crossroads of Asia, Singapore acts as a pivotal gateway to the entire region. Its strategic location facilitates seamless trade and business opportunities with neighboring nations</li>
  <li>Global financial powerhouse: Singapore shines as a global epicenter of financial services. Hosting a plethora of international banks, investment firms, family offices, and financial institutions, it presents unparalleled prospects in finance, banking, and wealth management</li>
  <li>English as a universal language: The widespread use and understanding of English in Singapore foster an environment where expatriates and professionals easily communicate and assimilate into both local society and the workplace</li>
  <li>A universe of career possibilities: Singapore’s dynamic economy offers an extensive array of job prospects spanning diverse industries, from finance and technology to healthcare and hospitality. More on this later</li>
  <li>Exposure to talent from around the world: Singapore provides professionals with the opportunity to build global networks and collaborate with kindred spirits</li>
  <li>Conducive business environment: Singapore’s streamlined bureaucracy, efficient legal framework, and straightforward business procedures contribute to a fertile ground for establishing and nurturing enterprises</li>
</ul>

<p>Heads-up: For those who are planning to move, the easiest way is through an internal transfer from your company (ideally a MNC). Sponsoring employment passes is becoming increasingly difficult in Singapore given the state of the economy and an increasing number of applicants.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-top-industries-in-singapore">What are the top industries in Singapore?</h4>

<p>Singapore’s economy thrives on a diverse range of industries, offering a wide array of career options. Some of the top industries that contribute significantly to the country’s GDP and job market include:</p>

Singapore’s local banks, such as DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, and United Overseas Bank (UOB), offer diverse career paths. International banks like Citibank, Standard Chartered, and J.P. Morgan have established a strong presence in Singapore. I’d say Finance is still stronger in HK and Shanghai versus Singapore, but the gap is closing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tech: Singapore places a strong emphasis on digital transformation, making its IT sector a dynamic and rapidly growing industry. Job opportunities exist in software development, cybersecurity, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Global tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have set up regional headquarters in Singapore, attracting talent from around the world. Additionally, local tech companies like Grab and Sea Limited have gained prominence, although they are evidently struggling at the moment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bio-med / pharma: Singapore has established itself as a prominent player in the biomedical field. It houses renowned research institutes, pharmaceutical companies, and biotech firms.

Local healthcare institutions such as Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and National University Hospital (NUH) offer rewarding careers in the healthcare sector too and has decent compensation</p>

Job seekers with engineering expertise are in demand, especially in areas such as semiconductor manufacturing, industrial automation, and renewable energy.

<h4 id="what-roles-are-in-top-demand">What roles are in top demand?</h4>

<p>To excel in your job search, it is essential to understand the roles that are currently in high demand in Singapore’s competitive job market. Some of the top roles sought after by employers include:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="whats-the-state-of-the-job-market-right-now">What’s the state of the job market right now?</h4>

<p>I echoed this in the introduction, but times are tough for the unemployed, as evident from a recent Strait Times report stating that Singapore’s labor demand is cooling due to economic uncertainty and global headwinds. This trend is prevalent worldwide. Singapore’s rising cost of living and the increasing challenge of obtaining an employment pass sponsorship could lead to a short-term decline in foreign talent. However, I anticipate a robust and opportunistic Singapore job market in the long term. Share your experiences with the Singapore job search market in the comments or via email.</p>

He’s not poor, but let’s just say he’s a little obnoxious and insistent. When he visited Singapore a few weeks back, he could not shut up about how high quality the McDonalds is here. With a localized menu and somewhat well-executed food items, McDonalds is seen as a medium-end eatery in SIngapore given hawker center food is cheaper (sometimes up to 50% cheaper). Today, we’ll unpack McDonalds in Singapore, why it’s such a beloved institution and how to order from McDonalds Singapore so you won’t miss out on the goodness.</p>

<p>McDonald’s made its entry into Singapore in 1979. The first McDonald’s restaurant in Singapore was opened on March 8, 1979, at Liat Towers along Orchard Road, one of the city-state’s main shopping districts. The introduction of McDonald’s in Singapore marked the beginning of the fast-food industry’s development in the country and brought about significant changes in the local dining scene. Since then, McDonald’s has expanded its presence in Singapore, opening numerous locations across the country, including standalone restaurants, outlets in shopping malls, and drive-thru locations. Today, McDonald’s is a well-established and widely recognized fast-food chain in Singapore, serving a variety of menu items tailored to local tastes alongside their global offerings.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-mcdonalds-so-loved-in-singapore">Why is McDonalds so loved in Singapore?</h4>

<p>A Taste of Familiarity and Consistency: McDonald’s brings a sense of familiarity to Singaporeans’ palates. The taste, quality, and service consistency offered by McDonald’s worldwide is a major draw. Whether it’s the iconic Big Mac or the addictive Chicken McNuggets, there’s something undeniably comforting about indulging in these well-known flavors that we’ve grown up with.
Convenience, Convenience, Convenience: One word that perfectly describes McDonald’s in Singapore is “convenience.” With its widespread presence across the island, you’re never too far away from a McDonald’s outlet. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite, a takeaway meal, or even a late-night munchie, McDonald’s has you covered. The accessibility and round-the-clock operation of select locations make it a go-to choice for time-pressed individuals and hungry souls alike.
Catering to Local Tastes: McDonald’s understands the importance of catering to Singaporeans’ diverse palates. They have cleverly adapted their menu to include localized items that hit all the right spots. From the fiery McSpicy to the beloved McChicken, McDonald’s has perfected the art of creating dishes that resonate with our local flavors. These adaptations demonstrate their commitment to staying relevant and meeting the cravings of their Singaporean customers.
Somewhat Value-for-Money Meals: Living in a city known for its higher cost of living, finding an affordable dining option can be a challenge. McDonald’s, however, comes to the rescue with its value-for-money meals and pocket-friendly promotions. The combination of affordable pricing and satisfying portions makes it an appealing choice for budget-conscious individuals, families, and students looking to enjoy a satisfying meal without breaking the bank.
A Gathering Place for All: Step inside any McDonald’s outlet in Singapore, and you’ll find it buzzing with activity. From friends catching up over a meal to families enjoying a weekend outing, McDonald’s acts as a social hub for the community. With comfortable seating arrangements and a welcoming atmosphere, it provides a casual setting where people can connect, share stories, and create memories.
Embracing Innovation: In a rapidly evolving digital age, McDonald’s Singapore has embraced innovation to enhance the dining experience. Self-ordering kiosks, mobile ordering, and efficient delivery services have become the norm. These technological advancements cater to the preferences of tech-savvy customers, ensuring a seamless and convenient experience for those on the go.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-mcdonald-prices-higher-in-singapore">Why are McDonald prices higher in Singapore?</h4>

<p>Several factors contribute to the relatively higher prices of McDonald’s in Singapore compared to some other countries. Here are a few reasons:
Operating Costs: Singapore has a high cost of living and a relatively high standard of wages and labor costs. The cost of labor, rent, utilities, and other operational expenses for businesses, including McDonald’s, is generally higher in Singapore compared to many other countries. These higher operating costs can result in higher prices for products and services.
Import Costs: Singapore relies heavily on imports for its food supply. McDonald’s ingredients, such as beef, chicken, and certain produce, may need to be imported from other countries. Importing these items can involve additional transportation, handling, and custom duties, which can increase the overall cost of sourcing ingredients and impact the final pricing of the menu items.
Premium Locations: McDonald’s restaurants in Singapore are often strategically located in prime areas, such as shopping malls, busy city centers, or tourist destinations. These prime locations come with higher rental costs, which can be a significant factor in the overall pricing of the products.
Local Taxes and Regulations: Singapore has various taxes and regulations that businesses must comply with. These include goods and services tax (GST), import duties, and other levies that may affect the overall cost structure of McDonald’s operations and subsequently impact the pricing of their products.
Menu Customization: McDonald’s in Singapore often offers menu items customized to suit local tastes and preferences. The additional effort and costs associated with developing and producing these customized items can contribute to higher prices compared to standard menu items in other countries.</p>

With a localized menu and somewhat well-executed food items, McDonalds is seen as a medium-end eatery in SIngapore given hawker center food is cheaper (sometimes up to 50% cheaper).

However, we are now back!</p>

<p>A few of my friends have been visiting Singapore and have asked me to create an itinerary for them. Many ask whether there are things to do in Singapore. The answer is yes and no. Singapore is a small but mighty city-state that offers a world of experiences within its compact borders. Despite its size, this dynamic metropolis is packed with iconic landmarks, cultural enclaves, stunning gardens, delectable cuisine, and much more. Overall, I recommend 3 days as the optimal amount of time to spend in Singapore. Anything more and you’ll be struggling to find things to do. Here’s the itinerary below. Note - we’ll save a more in-depth restaurant / bars guide for another time.</p>

<h4 id="day-1">Day 1:</h4>

<p><u>Morning<u></u></u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Breakfast at Ya Kun: Start your Singapore adventure with a hearty breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya Toast, a local favorite known for its traditional Singaporean breakfast. Indulge in crispy toast slathered with kaya (coconut jam) and paired with soft-boiled eggs and a cup of aromatic kopi (local coffee). Ya Kun’s are everywhere so it’s not hard to find. Alternatively, visiting Toast Box is ok too.</li>
  <li>Chinatown: After breakfast, make your way to Chinatown, a vibrant district teeming with colorful shophouses, bustling markets, and rich cultural heritage. Take a leisurely stroll along the vibrant streets, visit the historic Sri Mariamman Temple, and savor delicious local street food at the Chinatown Food Street.</li>

Alternatively, check out the large Tiong Bahru Hawker center market for a local lunch, including Char Kway Teow, Chicken rice and Bak Chor Mee</li>
