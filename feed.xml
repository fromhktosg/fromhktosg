As Chinese New Year approaches, it seems nothing says “festive celebration” quite like a McSpicy and fries, because who needs tradition when you have convenience? In this article, we’ll dive into whether McDonald’s is still worth the splurge, what limited-edition goodies they’re rolling out for the season, and how you can snag the highly coveted Melody Mahjong set before it inevitably sells out.</p>

<h3 id="how-has-mcdonalds-in-singapore-been-the-past-year">How has McDonald’s in Singapore been the past year?</h3>

<p>Over the past year, McDonald’s Singapore has experienced notable changes, particularly in pricing and operational strategies. In response to inflationary pressures, the company has implemented price adjustments, including the introduction of charges for additional condiments such as curry and honey mustard sauces, effective from January 2025.</p>

<p>Despite these price increases, McDonald’s has continued to offer value promotions to attract customers. For instance, in October 2024, a buy-one-get-one-free promotion for Samurai Burgers was available exclusively for McDonald’s members.</p>

<p>On the corporate front, McDonald’s Corporation (MCD) has shown resilience in the stock market. Starting 2024 at $285.96, the stock traded at approximately $298.84 by the end of the year, marking a 5% increase.</p>

<p>However, the company faced challenges, including an E. coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder hamburgers in October 2024, which temporarily impacted its stock price.</p>

<p>In summary, while McDonald’s Singapore has adjusted its pricing in response to economic factors, it continues to implement promotional strategies to maintain customer engagement. The parent company’s stock has demonstrated growth over the past year, despite facing certain operational challenges.</p>

<p>In 2024, McDonald’s Singapore delighted customers with a variety of seasonal burgers, each offering unique flavors and experiences. Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sweet BBQ McSpicy® with Egg &amp; Cheese: Introduced in August 2024, this burger features the classic spicy chicken cutlet enhanced with sweet BBQ crème sauce, a fried egg, and melted cheese. It was available as part of an Extra Value Meal starting from S$8.00.</li>
  <li>Sweet BBQ McSpicy® with Chicken Bacon: Launched alongside the Egg &amp; Cheese variant, this burger combines the fiery McSpicy® patty with sweet BBQ crème sauce and crispy chicken bacon. The Extra Value Meal was priced from S$8.00.</li>
  <li>Samurai Beef Burger: Making a comeback in September 2024, this fan-favorite includes a juicy teriyaki-glazed beef patty, crisp lettuce, and creamy mayonnaise. The Extra Value Meal started at S$7.95.</li>
  <li>Samurai Chicken Burger: Also reintroduced in September 2024, this burger offers a tender teriyaki-glazed chicken patty with lettuce and mayonnaise. The Extra Value Meal was available from S$7.95.</li>
  <li>Tamago Samurai Beef Burger: A new addition in September 2024, this burger elevates the classic Samurai Beef Burger by adding a crispy fried egg. The Extra Value Meal was priced from S$8.95.</li>
  <li>Tamago Samurai Chicken Burger: Introduced alongside its beef counterpart, this burger features a teriyaki chicken patty topped with a fried egg. The Extra Value Meal started at S$8.95.</li>

In this article, we’ll explore the pros and cons of flying budget airlines, including top options available in Singapore, the routes they cover, and safety concerns highlighted by recent incidents like the Jeju Air accident. Whether you’re wondering if budget airlines are safe or if they’re worth the savings, we’ll help you decide if flying budget is the right choice for your next trip.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-budget-airlines">What are budget airlines?</h3>

<p>Budget airlines, also known as low-cost carriers (LCCs), are airlines that provide air travel at significantly lower prices compared to traditional full-service carriers. They achieve this by minimizing operating costs and offering a no-frills flying experience, often charging separately for services like baggage, seat selection, meals, and in-flight entertainment. Budget airlines cater to cost-conscious travelers who prioritize affordability over additional perks, making them a popular choice for short-haul and regional flights.</p>

<p>Key Features of Budget Airlines</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lower Ticket Prices: Budget airlines focus on affordability, offering base fares that are often a fraction of the cost of full-service carriers.</li>
  <li>Pay-As-You-Go Services: Passengers pay for extras like checked luggage, priority boarding, and meals, allowing for a customizable travel experience.</li>
  <li>Efficient Operations: Budget airlines typically use a single aircraft model to reduce maintenance and training costs, operate direct point-to-point routes, and use secondary airports to save on landing fees.</li>
  <li>Streamlined Customer Service: Many budget airlines operate primarily online, reducing the need for physical offices or extensive customer service staff.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-fly-budget-airlines">Why fly budget airlines?</h3>

<p>Advantages of Budget Airlines</p>

<ul>
  <li>Affordability: The biggest appeal of budget airlines is their low fares, making travel accessible to a wider audience.</li>
  <li>Frequent Deals and Promotions: Flash sales and promotional offers further reduce costs, attracting leisure travelers.</li>
  <li>Flexibility for Minimalists: Travelers who don’t need extras can benefit from lower prices by opting out of additional services.</li>
  <li>Wider Reach: Budget airlines often open up travel to destinations not frequently served by full-service carriers, enhancing connectivity. For example, cebu pacific allows you fly to specific destinations in the Philippines</li>

<p>Risks of Budget Airlines</p>

<p><u>Hidden Fees<u>
Low base fares often exclude essentials like checked baggage, seat selection, meals, and even carry-on luggage.
Passengers may face high fees for last-minute changes or exceeding baggage limits, significantly increasing overall costs.</u></u></p>

<p><u>Smaller Seats and Less Comfort<u>
Budget airlines maximize seating capacity, leading to narrower seats, less legroom, and limited recline.
Long-haul flights can be uncomfortable, especially for passengers who value extra space.</u></u></p>

<p><u>Safety Concerns<u>
While budget airlines meet international safety standards, recent incidents, such as the Jeju Air accident, have raised concerns about maintenance practices and pilot fatigue due to cost-cutting measures.
Lower operating costs may sometimes lead to reduced maintenance budgets or reliance on outsourced services.</u></u></p>

<p><u>Delays and Cancellations<u>
Budget airlines operate on tight schedules, leaving little room for delays.
Flight disruptions can lead to long wait times, and compensation policies may not be as generous as full-service carriers.</u></u></p>

<p><u>Secondary Airports<u>
Many budget airlines use secondary airports located farther from city centers to reduce costs.
This can lead to higher transportation expenses and longer travel times after landing.</u></u></p>

<p><u>Limited Customer Support<u>
Customer service is often minimal, with fewer physical counters and reliance on online platforms for support.
Resolving issues like lost luggage or refunds may be slower and more complicated.</u></u></p>

<p><u>Fewer Amenities<u>
No in-flight entertainment, free meals, or complimentary drinks unless purchased separately.
Passengers must pay for extras, which can add up, reducing the overall cost savings.</u></u></p>

<p>While budget airlines offer affordable travel options, passengers should carefully review terms and conditions, account for extra fees, and prepare for limited services. Assessing risks and planning ahead can help avoid unpleasant surprises during the journey.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-so-many-budget-airlines-having-accidents-these-days">Why are so many budget airlines having accidents these days?</h3>

<p>Budget airlines have grown rapidly over the past two decades, offering affordable travel to millions of passengers. However, recent incidents, including the Jeju Air accident, have raised concerns about the safety of low-cost carriers. While budget airlines must comply with international safety standards, several factors may contribute to their higher accident rates compared to full-service carriers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cost-Cutting Measures
Maintenance Practices: Budget airlines often outsource aircraft maintenance to third-party providers to reduce costs, which may lead to inconsistent quality control.
Pilot Fatigue: To maximize efficiency, pilots may have tighter schedules, leading to fatigue and reduced performance during critical moments.
Older Fleets: Some budget carriers operate older planes to save costs, which may require more frequent maintenance and pose higher risks if not properly serviced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High Flight Frequency
Budget airlines operate more flights daily to maximize profitability.
Quick turnarounds between flights leave less time for thorough safety inspections and repairs, increasing the potential for mechanical issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less Experienced Staff
Budget airlines often hire younger or less experienced pilots and crew members to save costs.
While they are certified, they may lack the extensive training or experience that pilots in legacy airlines have, especially in handling emergencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressure to Maintain Profitability
Intense competition in the low-cost carrier market creates pressure to cut expenses, potentially impacting safety investments, such as training programs or upgrades to safety systems.
Tight profit margins may also delay improvements to infrastructure and equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expanding Routes into Challenging Regions
Budget airlines often open routes to remote areas with less developed infrastructure and airports, increasing risks during takeoffs and landings.
Poor weather conditions and limited support services in such areas can further compound risks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growing Demand and Overcrowded Skies
With more travelers choosing budget airlines, air traffic congestion has increased, raising the likelihood of errors and incidents.
High traffic can strain air traffic control systems, particularly in regions with rapid aviation growth.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Are Budget Airlines Still Safe?
Despite these concerns, most budget airlines still adhere to international aviation safety standards regulated by authorities like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). Incidents often attract media attention, but statistically, air travel—including budget airlines—remains one of the safest modes of transportation.</p>

<p>While budget airlines remain generally safe, passengers should stay informed about an airline’s safety record and reviews. Booking with well-established carriers, even among low-cost options, can provide extra reassurance.</p>

This guide will explore why countries have lotteries, the history of Singapore’s lottery system, and reasons people participate in lottery games. It will also cover where to buy lottery tickets in Singapore and potential earnings from popular games like Toto and Singapore Sweep.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-countries-have-a-lottery-system">Why Do Countries Have a Lottery System?</h3>

<p>Lotteries have been a part of human society for centuries, serving various purposes across different cultures and nations. Today, most countries have some form of lottery system, ranging from national games to regional draws. But what drives governments to implement and maintain these systems? Here, we explore the primary reasons why countries have lottery systems and their impact on society.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Revenue Generation for Public Services
One of the main reasons governments establish lotteries is to generate additional revenue for public services without increasing taxes. Funds collected from lottery ticket sales often support education, healthcare, infrastructure development, and other social programs. For instance, profits from Singapore Pools, the nation’s legal lottery operator, contribute to charitable organizations and community projects, benefiting the broader public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Curbing Illegal Gambling
Many countries introduce legal lotteries to combat illegal gambling activities. By providing a safe and regulated alternative, governments can oversee and control betting practices while minimizing the risks associated with unregulated gambling markets. Legal lottery systems ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability, protecting consumers from fraud and exploitation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Economic Boost and Job Creation
Lottery systems create employment opportunities in sectors such as retail, marketing, and administration. They also stimulate economic activity by encouraging consumer spending. In Singapore, lottery outlets and online platforms operated by Singapore Pools employ numerous staff and support local businesses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entertainment and Social Engagement
For many participants, lotteries offer entertainment and excitement. The anticipation of winning a jackpot provides a sense of thrill and hope, making lotteries a popular pastime. Group participation in lottery draws can also foster social bonding, as friends and colleagues often pool money to purchase tickets together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funding Charitable Causes
In addition to public services, lotteries frequently support charities and non-profit organizations. A portion of the proceeds is allocated to funding initiatives that address societal issues such as poverty, education, and disaster relief. This charitable aspect enhances the lottery’s appeal as participants feel their contributions benefit the community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Psychological Motivation and Aspirations
Lotteries tap into human psychology by offering the dream of financial freedom. People are often motivated by the chance, however slim, of transforming their lives overnight. This aspiration drives consistent participation and keeps lotteries popular despite low odds of winning.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="history-of-singapores-lottery-system">History of Singapore’s lottery system</h3>

<p>Singapore’s lottery system has a structured and regulated history, evolving to meet public demand and control illegal gambling.</p>

Singapore Pools remained under strict regulation by the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-chinese-new-year-so-important">Why is Chinese New Year so important?</h3>

<p>Chinese New Year holds deep cultural and historical significance as it symbolizes renewal, prosperity, and family unity. It marks the end of winter and the arrival of spring, bringing hopes of good fortune and success for the year ahead. Traditions like family reunions, feasting, and exchanging red packets highlight values of gratitude, respect, and generosity. The festival also honors ancestors and deities through prayers and offerings, emphasizing cultural heritage and spirituality. Beyond its traditional roots, Chinese New Year serves as a reminder of shared values and community bonding, making it a cornerstone of cultural identity in Singapore.</p>

<p>This festival is not only about celebrations but also reflects deeply ingrained beliefs and customs. Cleaning homes before the new year symbolizes sweeping away bad luck, while decorating with red and gold represents good fortune and happiness. The reunion dinner on New Year’s Eve is one of the most anticipated events, bringing families together to strengthen bonds and share blessings.

In today’s post, we’ll discuss the International Baccalaureate (IB) program specifically. This rigorous two-year diploma program, emphasizing critical thinking and global perspectives, is now offered at leading institutions like Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and St. Joseph’s Institution International. While the IB’s inquiry-based approach differs from Singapore’s structured local system, both paths offer distinct challenges and opportunities for academic excellence, making the choice less about difficulty and more about finding the right educational fit. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h3 id="singapore-education-system">Singapore education system</h3>

<p>Singapore’s local education system follows a structured pathway that begins with six years of primary education, culminating in the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). This national examination is a crucial milestone that determines students’ placement in secondary schools through a merit-based posting system. The primary curriculum emphasizes core subjects including English, Mother Tongue languages, Mathematics, and Science, with a strong focus on building fundamental knowledge and skills.
Following primary school, students enter secondary education where they are streamed into different academic tracks - Express, Normal (Academic), or Normal (Technical) - based on their PSLE results. The Express stream leads to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level examinations after four years, while the Normal streams typically take five years to complete their secondary education. This system, while often criticized for its high-stakes testing and academic pressure, has consistently produced strong outcomes in international assessments and is credited with contributing to Singapore’s economic success through the development of a skilled workforce.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ib">What is IB?</h3>

<p>The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme is a globally recognized pre-university qualification designed for students aged 16-19. Established in 1968 in Geneva, Switzerland, the program has evolved from its original purpose of serving globally mobile students to become a highly respected curriculum emphasizing both academic excellence and personal development.
The program’s structure revolves around three core elements: Theory of Knowledge (TOK), which explores the nature of knowledge; the Extended Essay, a 4,000-word independent research paper; and Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS), which promotes holistic development through extracurricular engagement. Students must also study six subjects across different groups, with three at Higher Level and three at Standard Level.</p>

<p>Assessment in the IB is comprehensive, combining continuous evaluation through presentations, research papers, and projects with final external examinations. Students can earn up to 45 points, with 42 from their six subjects and 3 bonus points from TOK and Extended Essay. The program emphasizes critical thinking, international-mindedness, and research skills, preparing students effectively for university education.</p>

<p>Universities worldwide value the IB Diploma highly, often offering advanced standing or credit to graduates. The program’s demanding nature helps develop crucial skills like time management, critical analysis, and independent research. However, it comes with challenges, including a substantial workload and higher costs due to teacher training and program administration requirements.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, the IB continues to grow in popularity globally, including in Singapore. Its success in preparing students for higher education while developing well-rounded individuals has established it as a leading pre-university qualification. The program offers more than just academic preparation – it provides a transformative educational experience that develops critical thinking, research capabilities, and global awareness.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-more-and-more-people-taking-ib-in-singapore">Why are more and more people taking IB in Singapore?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The growing demand for international education has led many Singapore families to consider IB as a pathway that offers greater global mobility and recognition, particularly for students planning to study abroad at top universities in the US, UK, and Europe.</li>
  <li>The IB’s inquiry-based learning approach and emphasis on critical thinking appeals to parents who prefer a more holistic education system over Singapore’s traditionally exam-focused curriculum, believing it better prepares students for the evolving demands of the modern workforce.</li>
  <li>Singapore’s increasing role as a global hub has brought more expatriate families and returning Singaporeans who are familiar with or prefer international curricula, driving demand for IB programs across the island.</li>
  <li>The success of established Singapore schools offering IB, such as Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and School of the Arts (SOTA), has helped build confidence in the program’s ability to deliver strong academic outcomes while maintaining high standards comparable to the local system.</li>
  <li>The IB’s focus on developing well-rounded individuals through mandatory components like Theory of Knowledge and Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) resonates with parents who want their children to develop soft skills and global perspectives alongside academic excellence.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schools-that-offer-ib">Schools that offer IB</h3>

<p>Local Schools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) - One of Singapore’s most prestigious schools offering the IB Diploma Programme</li>

<h3 id="average-ib-scores-for-singapore">Average IB scores for Singapore</h3>

<p>Singapore consistently excels in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme, with students achieving well above the global average. Here’s an overview of performance by school type:</p>

<p>Local Schools: Local schools typically outperform international schools in average IB scores. For instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anglo-Chinese School (Independent): Average score above 41 points, with multiple students achieving the perfect score of 45.</li>
  <li>Hwa Chong International School: Frequently reports scores above 40 points.</li>
</ul>

<p>International Schools: International schools also perform well but generally have slightly lower averages compared to local schools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tanglin Trust School: Average score of 39.1 points.</li>
  <li>Dulwich College (Singapore): Average score of 37.6 points.</li>
  <li>Overseas Family School (OFS): Average score of 35 points.</li>
  <li>NPS International School: Average score of 38.1 points.</li>
  <li>Many international schools cater to a broader range of students, including those new to the IB curriculum, which may impact average scores.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I’d recommend IB as a way to shift away from the harsher local curriculum and to have a more recognized gateway into international.

what makes it a standout destination, and the attractions that draw millions each year. I’ll also 
touch on potential drawbacks, future developments, and share tips on the best activities and 
dining spots. Whether you’re planning a visit or just curious, this guide will cover it all!</p>

<p><strong>Where is Sentosa</strong></p>

<p>Sentosa is located just off the southern coast of Singapore, connected to the mainland by a 
causeway, cable car, and monorail. It’s situated near HarbourFront, accessible via Sentosa Gateway 
or VivoCity, making it a convenient destination for both locals and tourists. This island resort 
spans 500 hectares and is a hub for leisure, entertainment, and relaxation.</p>

<p><strong>History of Sentosa</strong></p>

<p>Sentosa’s story is as fascinating as the island itself—a tale of transformation from a sleepy 
outpost to Singapore’s favorite playground. Back in the day, it was called Pulau Blakang Mati, 
which roughly translates to “Island of Death from Behind.” The eerie name likely stemmed from its 
history of pirate attacks or malaria outbreaks, but the island’s strategic location made it far 
too valuable to ignore. The British turned it into a military stronghold, building Fort Siloso to 
defend Singapore’s vital shipping lanes. During World War II, this fort played a key role in 
Singapore’s defense, though it couldn’t prevent the island from falling to the Japanese.</p>

<p>After the war, Sentosa remained a military base for a while, but Singapore had bigger plans for 
the island. In 1972, it was renamed “Sentosa,” meaning “peace and tranquility” in Malay—a total 
rebranding to shake off its grim past and signal a bright future. What followed was an ambitious 
transformation: beaches were built, a cable car was launched, and iconic landmarks like the 
Merlion statue started to shape the island’s identity as a tourist destination.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the late 2000s, Sentosa leveled up big time. Resorts World Sentosa brought in 
Universal Studios Singapore, world-class hotels, a casino, and the jaw-dropping S.E.A. Aquarium, 
turning the island into a global hotspot. And while its modern attractions get all the hype, 
places like Fort Siloso remind visitors of the island’s rich history.</p>

<p>Sentosa today is a symbol of Singapore’s incredible ability to evolve and innovate. From its 
colonial roots to its vibrant present, the island’s journey is nothing short of inspiring—a story 
that makes every visit feel like stepping into a piece of living history.</p>

high-quality figurines in randomized sets. Inspired by this element of surprise, companies began 
packaging collectibles into mystery boxes sold in stores. Blind boxes often feature themed series, 
encouraging buyers to collect entire sets while embracing the unpredictability of what they might 
receive. This format reflects Japanese culture’s appreciation for craftsmanship, attention to 
detail, and playful curiosity. The blend of suspense and the joy of discovery has made blind boxes 
an enduring and creative facet of Japanese consumer culture.</p>

<p>The blind box phenomenon spread to China in the 2010s, where it quickly gained traction among 
young consumers. This growth was driven by a combination of cultural and market dynamics, 
including the appeal of surprise, collectability, and the integration of blind boxes with popular 
characters from comics, games, and local culture. Chinese companies adapted the concept, creating 
products with intricate designs and limited editions, which further fueled demand. Social media 
and e-commerce platforms played a significant role in the expansion, allowing collectors to 
showcase their finds, trade items, and purchase boxes easily. The introduction of blind boxes in 
large retail chains and specialized stores cemented their popularity, transforming them into a 
significant aspect of contemporary youth culture in China.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-blind-box-toys-made-of">What are blind box toys made of</h3>

<p>Blind box toys are primarily made from <strong>plastic materials</strong>, such as <strong>vinyl</strong> and <strong>PVC 
(polyvinyl chloride)</strong>, which allow for detailed molding and vibrant colors. Vinyl is particularly 
popular for its durability and ability to create smooth, high-quality finishes, while PVC is 
favored for its versatility and cost-effectiveness. Depending on the complexity of the toy, some 
blind box figures may also include parts made from <strong>ABS plastic</strong>, a more rigid material often 
used for intricate details or structural elements.</p>

<p>In addition to plastics, some blind box toys feature <strong>paint applications</strong>, often applied by hand 
or with precision machinery to ensure fine details. Occasionally, additional materials like 
<strong>metal accents</strong>, <strong>fabric</strong>, or even <strong>silicone</strong> are incorporated to enhance the design, 
creating unique textures or special features.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-people-crazy-about-blind-boxes">Why are people crazy about blind boxes</h3>

<p>The allure of blind boxes lies deeply in human psychology, tapping into our innate curiosity and 
love for surprises. The concept of not knowing what you’re going to get creates a thrill similar 
to opening a gift, which is inherently exciting and often linked to feelings of nostalgia. Many 
collectors find joy in the process of discovery, especially when there’s a chance to unearth rare 
or exclusive figures, such as <strong>Labubu</strong> or <strong>Lisa</strong>, which have become iconic within certain 
collectible series. This uncertainty and potential for rarity trigger a dopamine rush, making the 
experience both enjoyable and addictive. The inclusion of rare “chase” figures adds another layer 
of excitement and drives repeated purchases, as collectors aim to complete sets or obtain 
particularly coveted designs.</p>

<p>Blind boxes also appeal as an <strong>affordable luxury</strong>, offering high-quality, artistically crafted 
toys at a price point that feels accessible. Unlike larger investments in collectibles, purchasing 
a blind box feels like a small indulgence, allowing buyers to own something unique without 
breaking the bank. This positioning as a “treat” helps broaden their appeal across different age 
groups, from children to adult collectors. Social media amplifies this effect, as unboxing videos 
and photos of collections flood platforms like Instagram and TikTok. People share their finds, 
trade duplicates, and show off their rare items, creating an online community that fuels 
enthusiasm. The visibility of rare figures and the social validation of showing off a complete set 
or rare item fosters a sense of belonging and encourages others to join in.</p>

<p>Beyond the psychological and social reasons, blind boxes also tap into broader cultural trends. 
The idea of <strong>curated randomness</strong> aligns with modern consumer behaviors, where people seek 
experiences as much as products. Opening a blind box is a mini-event, one that’s repeatable and 
always slightly different. For adults, they evoke feelings of nostalgia for childhood 
collectibles, while younger consumers are drawn to their cute designs and the joy of discovery. 
The combination of mystery, quality, and community makes blind boxes more than just toys—they are 
an experience that resonates across generations and cultures.</p>

for 2025 but also shedding light on why each religion receives equal recognition in the holiday 
calendar—a unique feature of Singapore’s multicultural society. We’ll highlight some lesser-known 
holidays and discuss how Singapore’s number of public holidays stacks up against other countries. 
From key national holidays to religious observances across different communities, let’s take a 
closer look at how Singapore honors its diversity through its holiday schedule.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-each-religion-have-the-same-amount-of-public-holidays-in-singapore">Why does each religion have the same amount of public holidays in singapore?</h3>

<p>In Singapore, each major religious group—primarily Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam—has 
an equal number of public holidays to promote a sense of balance, harmony, and inclusiveness in a 
multicultural society. This approach helps manage religious diversity and respects the unique 
cultural practices of each group, aiming to minimize potential conflicts. By giving each community 
the same number of holidays, Singapore upholds a neutral stance, avoiding favoritism that could 
lead to social division or tension.</p>

<p>This strategy reflects the government’s pragmatic approach to national unity, where harmony is 
prioritized over religious or cultural dominance. The equality of public holidays is thus part of 
Singapore’s broader policy of maintaining social stability and fostering a cohesive national 
identity in a religiously diverse population.</p>

<p>I think it’s a little extreme for the government to balance unity to such an extent, but whatever 
works.</p>

<h3 id="highlighting-a-few-public-holidays-you-may-not-know-about">Highlighting a few public holidays you may not know about</h3>

<p>Here’s an expanded look at selected public holidays in Singapore:</p>

<p>Chinese New Year<br />
The most significant holiday for Singapore’s Chinese community, Chinese New Year marks the beginning of the lunar calendar. Festivities last up to 15 days and include family gatherings, 
feasts, lion dances, and the exchange of red packets (ang baos) containing money, symbolizing luck 
and prosperity. Popular locations like Chinatown are adorned with decorations and filled with 
markets, making it a colorful celebration of unity and tradition.</p>

<p>Good Friday<br />
Good Friday is a solemn Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Observed 
by Singapore’s Christian community, this day is marked by special church services, prayers, and 
hymns reflecting on themes of sacrifice and forgiveness. Some Christians also engage in quiet 
reflection or charitable activities as a way of honoring the meaning behind the holiday.</p>

<p>Hari Raya Puasa (Eid al-Fitr)<br />
Known locally as Hari Raya Puasa, this Muslim holiday marks the end of Ramadan, the month of 
fasting. Families come together for prayers, and homes are opened to friends and family in a 
custom called “open houses,” where traditional dishes like rendang and ketupat are shared. The day 
represents renewal, forgiveness, and giving, with Muslims also fulfilling their zakat, or charity, 
obligations to support those in need.</p>

<p>Vesak Day<br />
Celebrated by Buddhists, Vesak Day honors the birth, enlightenment, and passing of Buddha. Temples 
are filled with devotees performing acts of charity, meditation, and prayers. Rituals include the 
“Bathing of the Buddha” ceremony, symbolizing purification and renewal. Many Buddhists also 
release caged birds or animals, representing compassion and the belief in the sanctity of life.</p>

<p>Hari Raya Haji (Eid al-Adha)<br />
Known globally as Eid al-Adha, Hari Raya Haji is celebrated by Muslims with communal prayers and 
the ritual sacrifice of livestock, commemorating Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son in 
obedience to God. Families share the meat with relatives and distribute portions to the less 
fortunate, reinforcing the values of charity, faith, and sacrifice.</p>

<p>Deepavali (Diwali)<br />
Also known as the festival of lights, Deepavali celebrates the victory of light over darkness, 
good over evil. Hindu families decorate their homes with lamps and rangoli (colorful floor art) to 
welcome blessings. The day is marked by temple visits, family gatherings, and traditional Indian 
sweets, signifying prosperity, joy, and the renewal of hope.</p>

<h3 id="does-singapore-have-a-lot-of-public-holidays-compared-to-other-countries">Does Singapore have a lot of public holidays compared to other countries?</h3>

<p>When ranked globally, Singapore falls around the mid-range in terms of public holidays. The 11 
public holidays observed in Singapore are moderate compared to other countries in Asia and beyond. 
For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High Holiday Countries: India tops the list with around 21-30 holidays per year, varying by state. Cambodia has 28 official holidays, and Thailand has around 19, making them some of the highest in Asia.</li>
  <li>Similar Holiday Counts: Other countries with similar holiday counts to Singapore include China 
with 11 public holidays and Malaysia with 14-16, though the latter varies regionally.</li>
  <li>Lower Holiday Counts: In contrast, the United States and Canada have around 10 federal holidays, 
while Australia has about 10-12, depending on the state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Singapore has fewer public holidays primarily to maintain economic productivity and efficiency. 
The government aims to keep businesses and services running smoothly while allowing for enough 
time off to recognize key cultural and religious observances. With 11 public holidays, Singapore 
balances the need for operational continuity with the desire to provide citizens with adequate 
time for rest and celebration. This approach helps position Singapore as a competitive, 
business-friendly hub in the global economy, reducing potential disruptions in the workplace while 
still allowing for important cultural recognition.</p>

game runs deep. We’ll explore why football, especially the English Premier League (EPL), is so 
popular in Singapore, taking a closer look at the unique reasons locals gravitate towards this 
league over others. We’ll also uncover which Premier League teams enjoy the most fan loyalty here, 
from Liverpool to Manchester United, and share top spots to catch a game—whether that’s at home on 
streaming services, at sports bars, or live TV. Let’s get into what makes Singapore’s love for 
football so compelling.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-singaporeans-like-watching-football">Why do singaporeans like watching football</h3>

<p>Singapore’s fervor for football is deeply ingrained in its history and culture, making it the 
nation’s most popular sport. This enthusiasm dates back to the colonial era when British 
expatriates introduced the game to Singapore. British soldiers and residents would play matches 
that attracted local fans and soon became an accessible pastime for locals. As Singapore 
transitioned from colony to independent nation, football only grew in significance. With the 
launch of the Malaysia Cup in the 1970s and 1980s, football ignited a sense of national pride and 
unity, as Singapore’s local teams competed against regional rivals. It was during this era that 
the sport took on a new role—not just as a game, but as a platform for Singaporeans to come 
together, cheer on their team, and build a sense of community and shared identity.</p>

<p>Football is now widely considered the most popular sport in Singapore. Its popularity spans across 
all demographics and is fueled by both local and international influences. Many Singaporeans are 
avid fans of the English Premier League (EPL), and matches are regularly broadcast in local sports 
bars, homes, and community venues, with major events often drawing large crowds. The Singapore 
Premier League also plays a key role in fostering local talent and football culture, further 
adding to the sport’s appeal.</p>

<p>Additionally, other sports like badminton and basketball are popular recreational activities, but 
football consistently ranks at the top, both as a spectator sport and a recreational activity. 
Football’s accessibility, with fields available across neighborhoods and schools, makes it easy 
for people to play, and it serves as a unifying force in Singapore’s multicultural society.</p>

<h3 id="why-premier-league-over-other-leagues">Why premier league over other leagues</h3>

<p>Singaporeans tend to prefer the English Premier League (EPL) over other leagues due to a mix of 
historical ties, the league’s high entertainment value, and its accessibility. Historically, as a 
former British colony, Singapore has long been influenced by British culture, including football, 
and this connection fostered early interest in English football that has only grown over time. The 
EPL itself is known for its high intensity, competitive spirit, and talent diversity, with 
world-class players from around the globe competing, which gives the matches a global appeal. 
Additionally, the EPL has been heavily marketed in Asia, particularly in Singapore, where it is 
broadcast in real-time with local commentary, making it easy for fans to follow.</p>
