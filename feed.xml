  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crypto / Blockchain: As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance, Singapore has positioned itself as a cryptocurrency and blockchain hub. Roles in this sector include blockchain developers, cryptocurrency analysts, and compliance specialists. Companies like Binance, CoinGecko, Huobi, and Zilliqa have established themselves as key players in Singapore’s cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.

<h4 id="whats-the-state-of-the-job-market-right-now">What’s the state of the job market right now?</h4>

<p>I echoed this in the introduction, but times are tough for the unemployed, as evident from a recent Strait Times report stating that Singapore’s labor demand is cooling due to economic uncertainty and global headwinds. This trend is prevalent worldwide. Singapore’s rising cost of living and the increasing challenge of obtaining an employment pass sponsorship could lead to a short-term decline in foreign talent. However, I anticipate a robust and opportunistic Singapore job market in the long term. Share your experiences with the Singapore job search market in the comments or via email.</p>

He’s not poor, but let’s just say he’s a little obnoxious and insistent. When he visited Singapore a few weeks back, he could not shut up about how high quality the McDonalds is here. With a localized menu and somewhat well-executed food items, McDonalds is seen as a medium-end eatery in SIngapore given hawker center food is cheaper (sometimes up to 50% cheaper). Today, we’ll unpack McDonalds in Singapore, why it’s such a beloved institution and how to order from McDonalds Singapore so you won’t miss out on the goodness.</p>

<p>McDonald’s made its entry into Singapore in 1979. The first McDonald’s restaurant in Singapore was opened on March 8, 1979, at Liat Towers along Orchard Road, one of the city-state’s main shopping districts. The introduction of McDonald’s in Singapore marked the beginning of the fast-food industry’s development in the country and brought about significant changes in the local dining scene. Since then, McDonald’s has expanded its presence in Singapore, opening numerous locations across the country, including standalone restaurants, outlets in shopping malls, and drive-thru locations. Today, McDonald’s is a well-established and widely recognized fast-food chain in Singapore, serving a variety of menu items tailored to local tastes alongside their global offerings.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-mcdonalds-so-loved-in-singapore">Why is McDonalds so loved in Singapore?</h4>

<p>A Taste of Familiarity and Consistency: McDonald’s brings a sense of familiarity to Singaporeans’ palates. The taste, quality, and service consistency offered by McDonald’s worldwide is a major draw. Whether it’s the iconic Big Mac or the addictive Chicken McNuggets, there’s something undeniably comforting about indulging in these well-known flavors that we’ve grown up with.
Convenience, Convenience, Convenience: One word that perfectly describes McDonald’s in Singapore is “convenience.” With its widespread presence across the island, you’re never too far away from a McDonald’s outlet. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite, a takeaway meal, or even a late-night munchie, McDonald’s has you covered. The accessibility and round-the-clock operation of select locations make it a go-to choice for time-pressed individuals and hungry souls alike.
Catering to Local Tastes: McDonald’s understands the importance of catering to Singaporeans’ diverse palates. They have cleverly adapted their menu to include localized items that hit all the right spots. From the fiery McSpicy to the beloved McChicken, McDonald’s has perfected the art of creating dishes that resonate with our local flavors. These adaptations demonstrate their commitment to staying relevant and meeting the cravings of their Singaporean customers.
Somewhat Value-for-Money Meals: Living in a city known for its higher cost of living, finding an affordable dining option can be a challenge. McDonald’s, however, comes to the rescue with its value-for-money meals and pocket-friendly promotions. The combination of affordable pricing and satisfying portions makes it an appealing choice for budget-conscious individuals, families, and students looking to enjoy a satisfying meal without breaking the bank.
A Gathering Place for All: Step inside any McDonald’s outlet in Singapore, and you’ll find it buzzing with activity. From friends catching up over a meal to families enjoying a weekend outing, McDonald’s acts as a social hub for the community. With comfortable seating arrangements and a welcoming atmosphere, it provides a casual setting where people can connect, share stories, and create memories.
Embracing Innovation: In a rapidly evolving digital age, McDonald’s Singapore has embraced innovation to enhance the dining experience. Self-ordering kiosks, mobile ordering, and efficient delivery services have become the norm. These technological advancements cater to the preferences of tech-savvy customers, ensuring a seamless and convenient experience for those on the go.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-mcdonald-prices-higher-in-singapore">Why are McDonald prices higher in Singapore?</h4>

<p>Several factors contribute to the relatively higher prices of McDonald’s in Singapore compared to some other countries. Here are a few reasons:
Operating Costs: Singapore has a high cost of living and a relatively high standard of wages and labor costs. The cost of labor, rent, utilities, and other operational expenses for businesses, including McDonald’s, is generally higher in Singapore compared to many other countries. These higher operating costs can result in higher prices for products and services.
Import Costs: Singapore relies heavily on imports for its food supply. McDonald’s ingredients, such as beef, chicken, and certain produce, may need to be imported from other countries. Importing these items can involve additional transportation, handling, and custom duties, which can increase the overall cost of sourcing ingredients and impact the final pricing of the menu items.
Premium Locations: McDonald’s restaurants in Singapore are often strategically located in prime areas, such as shopping malls, busy city centers, or tourist destinations. These prime locations come with higher rental costs, which can be a significant factor in the overall pricing of the products.
Local Taxes and Regulations: Singapore has various taxes and regulations that businesses must comply with. These include goods and services tax (GST), import duties, and other levies that may affect the overall cost structure of McDonald’s operations and subsequently impact the pricing of their products.
Menu Customization: McDonald’s in Singapore often offers menu items customized to suit local tastes and preferences. The additional effort and costs associated with developing and producing these customized items can contribute to higher prices compared to standard menu items in other countries.</p>

However, we are now back!</p>

<p>A few of my friends have been visiting Singapore and have asked me to create an itinerary for them. Many ask whether there are things to do in Singapore. The answer is yes and no. Singapore is a small but mighty city-state that offers a world of experiences within its compact borders. Despite its size, this dynamic metropolis is packed with iconic landmarks, cultural enclaves, stunning gardens, delectable cuisine, and much more. Overall, I recommend 3 days as the optimal amount of time to spend in Singapore. Anything more and you’ll be struggling to find things to do. Here’s the itinerary below. Note - we’ll save a more in-depth restaurant / bars guide for another time.</p>

<h4 id="day-1">Day 1:</h4>

<p><u>Morning<u></u></u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Breakfast at Ya Kun: Start your Singapore adventure with a hearty breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya Toast, a local favorite known for its traditional Singaporean breakfast. Indulge in crispy toast slathered with kaya (coconut jam) and paired with soft-boiled eggs and a cup of aromatic kopi (local coffee). Ya Kun’s are everywhere so it’s not hard to find. Alternatively, visiting Toast Box is ok too.</li>
  <li>Chinatown: After breakfast, make your way to Chinatown, a vibrant district teeming with colorful shophouses, bustling markets, and rich cultural heritage. Take a leisurely stroll along the vibrant streets, visit the historic Sri Mariamman Temple, and savor delicious local street food at the Chinatown Food Street.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Afternoon<u></u></u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tiong Bahru: Afterward, make your way to Tiong Bahru, a hip neighborhood known for its trendy cafes and charming heritage buildings. Enjoy a leisurely dinner at one of the local eateries, and explore the neighborhood’s unique boutiques and art galleries. Alternatively, check out the large Tiong Bahru Hawker center market for a local lunch, including Char Kway Teow, Chicken rice and Bak Chor Mee</li>

Familiarize yourself with the various modes of transportation and their respective routes. Be sure to tap your transport card (EZ-Link or Singapore Tourist Pass) when boarding buses and trains.</li>
  <li>Cleanliness and Hygiene: Singapore prides itself on cleanliness, and littering is heavily frowned upon. Dispose of trash in designated bins, and keep public spaces clean. Be mindful of personal hygiene, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Follow health and safety guidelines, such as wearing masks in public and maintaining social distancing.</li>
  <li>Tipping Culture: Tipping is not a common practice in Singapore, as a service charge is usually included in bills at hotels, restaurants, and cafes.</li>

I discussed my personal reasons in an earlier post, but that was based on my pre-move conception of the country. Now, after residing here for 5 years and witnessing the experiences of expats in Singapore, as well as interacting with locals, I can confidently state that there are clear-cut reasons for choosing to move to Singapore. With that in mind, I present to you my top ten reasons for living in Singapore.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Strong Economy: Singapore’s robust and thriving economy is one of the key reasons why many people choose to move here. As a global financial hub, the city-state provides abundant job opportunities in sectors such as finance, technology, healthcare, and logistics. Its business-friendly environment and supportive infrastructure make it an attractive destination for professionals seeking career growth. Singapore is also a stable nation that many value. The job opportunity I’ve had here parallels that of the US and is stronger than that of Hong Kong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safety and Security: No country is safer than Singapore. No one will deny this. Singapore consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, with low crime rates and efficient law enforcement. You can enjoy peace of mind and a secure environment for yourself and your family. Worried about going home at 3am? That’s not a concern in Singapore. Worried about getting pickpocketed on the train? That’s not a concern in Singapore. Worried about your kids being kidnapped from a park? That’s not a concern in Singapore. This is the biggest reason of why expats want to move to Singapore</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excellent Infrastructure: Singapore boasts world-class infrastructure, which is essential for a comfortable and convenient lifestyle. From a well-connected public transportation system to efficient public services, you’ll find that everything runs smoothly in this city-state. The MRT (subway) connects all over the island and is still expanding its presence with new train lines being built. Well-maintained roads, advanced healthcare facilities, and modern amenities contribute to a high standard of living. I</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cultural Diversity: One of Singapore’s greatest assets is its cultural diversity. With a mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western influences, the city-state embraces a multicultural society. This diversity is evident in its vibrant festivals, mouthwatering cuisine, and traditional customs. Living in Singapore means being part of a rich tapestry of cultures and enjoying a truly global experience. Is there racism? Yes. But that’s in any country, especially if you are an expat there. Are there clashes because of cultures and race? Yes. But that’s in any country as well. If anything, Singapore does a great job in maintaining racial harmony.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education System: If you have children or are pursuing higher education, Singapore’s renowned education system will be of great interest. The city-state is home to top-ranking universities (NUS broke into the top 10 in the world this year I believe), international schools, and well-structured academic programs. The emphasis on quality education ensures that students receive a solid foundation for their future success. For expats, Singapore international schools are some of the top notch in the world (see more about education here). The local education system is intense, but that’s why you send your child to private or international school if you can afford it. The same applies to other countries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clean: Despite being a bustling urban center, Singapore is committed to maintaining a clean and green environment. The government’s strict environmental policies have resulted in well-managed parks, gardens, and nature reserves. You can enjoy green spaces, pristine streets, and a city that takes pride in its cleanliness. Now, it’s almost hysterical to complain about this but all the cleanliness takes away from the grunge that any country should have. However, this is about reasons to live in Singapore, and cleanliness is apparent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Healthcare Excellence: Singapore’s healthcare system is world-class, with state-of-the-art medical facilities and highly skilled healthcare professionals. The country consistently ranks among the best in terms of healthcare outcomes and accessibility. You can have peace of mind knowing that quality healthcare services are readily available when you need them. Private and public healthcare is both amazing too. The country is tiny so a hospital is always at arms reach. Doctors are all quality (even the GPs though they look miserable) and it’s a luxury locals and expats in Singapore always forget</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Food and Dining: Prepare your taste buds for an unforgettable culinary adventure in Singapore. The city-state is renowned for its diverse food scene, offering a wide range of cuisines to satisfy every palate. From affordable street food at hawker centers to Michelin-starred restaurants, you’ll discover a gastronomic paradise where culinary delights await at every turn. I love that you can eat cheap if you want and then eat expensive the next day if that’s what you desire. Moving here for the food isn’t something people usually think about but it’s an unassuming luxury too. The issue with Singapore right now is that there are too many medium-priced food establishments that are not worth, but it takes time to really find what restaurants should be on your blacklist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travel Opportunities: Singapore’s strategic location in Southeast Asia makes it an ideal base for exploring the region. With excellent connectivity and transportation links, you can easily travel to neighboring countries and immerse yourself in diverse cultures, stunning landscapes, and unique experiences. Satiate your wanderlust and embark on exciting adventures just a short distance away. You’ll be able to get some great flight deals from this SEA hub too. I averaged 15-20 trips prior to COVID and now 5-7 trips post COVID. All from the heart of Singapore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quality of Life: Ultimately, moving to Singapore promises a high quality of life. With efficient public services, good infrastructure, a safe environment, and various amenities, you can enjoy a comfortable and prosperous lifestyle. Singapore consistently ranks well in global quality of life indexes, reflecting its commitment to providing a thriving and inclusive community for residents. Yes, the cost of living is high but taxes are low. You have the choice to live lavishly or not.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re seeking a dynamic and cosmopolitan city that offers tremendous opportunities, a diverse culture, and an excellent standard of living, Singapore could be the perfect destination for you. From its strong economy to its safe environment, world-class healthcare, and culinary delights, Singapore has much to offer. Consider these 10 compelling reasons as you contemplate your next chapter in life. I’ve talked about Singapore’s weaknesses. It’s time to talk about Singapore’s strengths too.

My friend’s kid seemed like a smart one - why drill more knowledge in her from such a young age? In an earlier post, I touched on the education system in Singapore and Hong Kong. Both countries place great emphasis on academic excellence, leading to a thriving tuition landscape in both regions. The perception of tuition being ingrained as a necessity by parents has sparked debates on its potential negative impact on children’s well-being and overall education system. In today’s post, we’ll dive into the emergence of tuition, effects the industry has on parents and children and a comparison of the top tuition centers and their marketing tactics in Hong Kong and Singapore. I’d say tuition is more common with locals, but an increasing number of expats in Singapore is exploring this. In case you missed out, check out my <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/education/">earlier article</a> on the education system of Singapore and how it fares against Hong Kong.</p>

<h4 id="emergence-of-tuition-as-an-industry">Emergence of tuition as an industry</h4>

<p><u> Hong Kong <u></u></u></p>

<p>The first tuition center in Hong Kong is believed to be Modern Education, established in 1971 by Mr. Lam Wing-kee. Initially, it aimed to provide supplementary education to students who needed extra assistance. Over time, tuition centers gained popularity due to the competitive nature of the education system and the desire for academic excellence. They became more mainstream in the 1980s and 1990s as the demand for additional academic support grew. Today, tuition centers are a common feature of the education landscape in Hong Kong, catering to students of all ages and academic levels.</p>

<p><u> Singapore <u></u></u></p>

<p>Tuition centers started emerging in Singapore in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As the education system became more competitive, the demand for additional academic support outside of school grew. This led to the establishment of the first tuition centers, which offered supplementary classes and coaching to help students excel in their studies. Over the years, the tuition industry in Singapore has continued to expand and evolve, with a wide range of centers catering to various subjects and academic levels.</p>

<h4 id="why-send-your-children-to-tuition-in-singapore">Why send your children to tuition in Singapore?</h4>

<p>TL;DR - helicopter parents are stressed about their kids not being superstars so they’ll do everything to give their kids a boost</p>

<ul>
  <li>Academic Excellence: Tuition is seen as a pathway to help children achieve better academic results and excel in their studies.</li>
  <li>Supplementing School Education: Tuition provides additional support beyond the regular school curriculum, helping students understand challenging subjects or topics.</li>
  <li>Competitive Academic Environment: Singapore’s competitive education system motivates parents to enroll their children in tuition to gain a competitive edge over their peers.</li>
  <li>Confidence Building: Tuition boosts students’ confidence by providing personalized attention, addressing their weaknesses, and enhancing their understanding of subjects.</li>
  <li>Individualized Learning: Tuition offers a customized learning experience, catering to each child’s unique learning style, pace, and specific needs.</li>
  <li>Addressing Learning Gaps: Tuition helps bridge any knowledge gaps, ensuring students keep up with the rigorous curriculum and stay on track with their peers.</li>
  <li>Enrichment Opportunities: Tuition can provide enrichment activities, projects, and resources that go beyond the school syllabus, broadening students’ knowledge and skills.</li>
  <li>Holistic Development: Some parents see tuition as a means to foster holistic development, focusing on critical thinking, problem-solving, and cultivating a passion for learning.</li>
  <li>Exam Preparation: Tuition centers often specialize in exam preparation, equipping students with effective study strategies, exam techniques, and practice materials.</li>
  <li>Parental Expectations: Parents may send their kids to tuition due to societal and parental expectations, believing that it is essential for their children’s academic success.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-do-these-tuition-centers-teach">How do these tuition centers teach?</h4>

<p>Every format you can think of. Depending on whether it’s catered to local Singaporeans or expats in Singapore, they can differ given a preference for smaller class size for the former. Listing a few here -</p>

<ul>
  <li>One-on-one sessions: Personalized attention and focused guidance.</li>
  <li>Group classes: Opportunities for interaction and peer learning.</li>
  <li>Large classes: A cost-effective option with a diverse learning environment.</li>
  <li>Recordings: Flexibility to revisit lessons and review materials.</li>
  <li>Mass streaming: Access to educational content on a larger scale.</li>
  <li>Hybrid models: Combination of in-person and online teaching for flexibility.</li>
  <li>Online platforms: Convenient and accessible learning experience.</li>
  <li>Classroom-based: Traditional setting with teacher-student interaction.</li>
  <li>Tutorial centers: Dedicated centers for subject-specific instruction.</li>
  <li>Home tuition: Individualized teaching in a familiar environment.</li>
  <li>Online tutoring: Virtual tutoring sessions for remote learning.</li>
  <li>Exam-focused crash courses: Intensive courses for exam preparation.</li>
  <li>Subject-specific coaching: Specialized instruction to enhance understanding.</li>
  <li>Remedial tuition: Targeted support for students who need extra help.</li>
  <li>Enrichment programs: Supplementary classes to broaden knowledge and skills.</li>
  <li>Preparatory classes: Preparation for educational transitions and exams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Covid accelerated the online models, and as shown in kdramas, you’ll get masses of students listening to a tutor livestream their teachings.</p>

<h4 id="tuition-in-relations-to-gifted-education-program-in-singapore">Tuition in relations to Gifted Education Program in Singapore</h4>

<p>One ting expats in Singapore may not know is that many go through tuition to get into a Gifted Education Program in Singapore. A Gifted Education Program (GEP) is a specialized educational program designed to meet the needs of academically gifted or talented students. It aims to provide a more challenging and enriched learning experience for students who demonstrate exceptional abilities in intellectual, creative, or specific academic domains. Funnily enough, those who get into GEP continue with education</p>

<p>The specific structure and implementation of GEP may vary between countries and educational systems. In general, however, the program identifies gifted students through various assessment methods, such as standardized tests, teacher recommendations, or portfolio assessments. Once identified, these students are offered specialized instruction and curriculum that goes beyond the standard curriculum provided to their peers.</p>

<p>Gifted education programs often feature accelerated learning, in-depth study of subjects, problem-solving activities, and opportunities for creativity and critical thinking. They may involve small class sizes, specialized teachers, and access to resources and enrichment activities not typically available in regular classrooms.</p>

<p>The goals of a Gifted Education Program are to nurture the talents and potential of gifted students, provide appropriate intellectual stimulation, foster their social and emotional development, and support their overall growth. These programs aim to challenge gifted students academically, help them reach their full potential, and prepare them for future academic and professional success.</p>

<p>Gifted education programs can be found at various levels of education, ranging from primary and secondary schools to higher education institutions. The specific criteria for eligibility and the nature of the program may differ based on the country’s educational policies and practices.</p>

<p>It is important to note that gifted education programs are designed to meet the unique needs of gifted students and provide them with an educational environment that supports their advanced abilities. The aim is to ensure that gifted students are appropriately challenged, engaged, and given opportunities to thrive academically and personally.</p>

<h4 id="so-how-much-is-spent-on-tuition">So how much is spent on tuition?</h4>

<p>The average spend on tuition in Singapore and Hong Kong varies based on factors such as the level of education, subjects, and the individual preferences of students and parents. In Singapore, where tuition is highly prevalent, the average monthly expenditure on tuition can range from SGD 200 to SGD 1,000 or more, depending on the grade level and intensity of the tuition sought. Some families may spend even higher amounts for specialized programs or individual tutoring. Here are a few stats for Singapore - 1) In 2019, Singapore families spent $1.4b on private tuition for kids last year, 2) 70% of parents send their child for tuition. 8 in 10 Primary school students and 6 in 10 Secondary school students pay for private tuition. This sounds pretty unhealthy to me, given the dollars and time invested.</p>

<p>In Hong Kong, the average spend on tuition is also significant, reflecting the competitive academic environment. The monthly expenditure on tuition can range from HKD 1,000 to HKD 5,000 or higher. Like in Singapore, the costs can vary based on the grade level, subjects, and the reputation and quality of the tuition center or private tutor.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that these figures are approximate averages and can vary significantly depending on individual circumstances. Factors such as the number of subjects, frequency of tuition sessions, and the specific educational goals of students and parents can influence the overall expenditure on tuition.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it’s worth mentioning that the tuition landscape in both Singapore and Hong Kong is highly diverse, with a wide range of options available at various price points. Families have the flexibility to choose from group tuition, private tutoring, online platforms, and specialized programs, each with its own cost structure.</p>

<p>Overall, while tuition can be a substantial financial commitment for families in both Singapore and Hong Kong, it is considered a valuable investment in students’ academic success and future prospects. The average spend on tuition reflects the importance placed on education and the willingness of parents to provide additional support to enhance their children’s learning experiences.</p>

<h4 id="negative-effects-of-tuition-and-enrichment-centers">Negative effects of tuition and enrichment centers</h4>

<p>Listing just a few…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Increased Academic Pressure:
Statistics from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) showed that Singaporean students reported higher levels of academic pressure compared to their international counterparts.
According to a survey conducted by the National Youth Council, around 90% of students in Singapore feel stressed about academic performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Impact on Mental Health:
The Institute of Mental Health reported that about 1 in 7 students aged 13 to 16 in Singapore experienced significant symptoms of anxiety and depression.
A study by the National University of Singapore found that high-stress levels due to academic pressure were associated with higher rates of mental health issues among students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduced Creativity and Well-Rounded Development:
The emphasis on academic achievement and structured learning in enrichment centers may limit opportunities for students to explore their creativity and develop a well-rounded skill set.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that Singaporean students had lower levels of creative problem-solving skills compared to their international peers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Financial Burden:
Enrichment programs can be expensive, adding to the financial burden on families. According to a survey by the Singapore Department of Statistics, education expenses accounted for a significant portion of household expenditure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Educational Inequality:
Higher-income families have greater access to enrichment centers, creating educational disparities between socioeconomic groups. This may perpetuate inequality and hinder equal opportunities for academic success.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m sure parents know of these reasons already, but it’s just part of Singapore society now. Tuition centers have woven themselves into the very fabric of Singapore, perpetuating a culture of excessive academic pressure and fostering a dependency on external help for success. This pervasive reliance on tuition has created a system where students feel inadequate without constant supplementary support, breeding a sense of insecurity and stifling their true potential.</p>

<h4 id="top-tuition-centers-in-hong-kong-and-singapore">Top tuition centers in Hong Kong and Singapore</h4>

<p>Top Tuition Centers in Hong Kong: In Hong Kong, several prominent tuition centers have established themselves as leaders in the industry. For instance, Beacon College, known for its strong track record in helping students excel in examinations, offers comprehensive programs and experienced tutors. Similarly, Modern Education, with its personalized approach and small class sizes, aims to provide individual attention to students. These centers employ marketing tactics such as testimonials from successful students, showcasing their achievements and emphasizing the effectiveness of their teaching methods. They also organize workshops and seminars to engage parents and highlight their centers’ expertise.</p>

<p>Top Tuition Centers in Singapore: Likewise, Singapore boasts several renowned tuition centers that have gained popularity among students and parents. The Learning Lab, known for its structured curriculum and highly qualified tutors, focuses on holistic development and academic excellence. Another notable center is MindChamps, which combines academic enrichment with character development, offering a unique approach to education. These centers employ marketing strategies such as informative websites, featuring their success stories and testimonials from satisfied parents. They also leverage social media platforms and collaborate with schools to enhance their visibility and reputation.</p>

<h4 id="marketing-tactics-of-these-tuition-centers">Marketing tactics of these tuition centers</h4>

<p>Let’s switch gears and discuss the marketing tactics of tuition centers.</p>

<p>In a predatory manner, tuition centers in both Hong Kong and Singapore employ manipulative marketing tactics to prey on students and their parents. Exploiting the fears and insecurities surrounding academic success, these centers boast about their high success rates, using testimonials and selective statistics to lure in vulnerable students. By forging partnerships with schools and leveraging online platforms, they establish an air of legitimacy and credibility, deceiving parents into believing that their services are necessary for their child’s educational advancement. These profit-driven establishments capitalize on the educational anxiety of families, perpetuating a toxic cycle of dependency and extracting financial gains at the expense of students’ well-being.</p>

<p>I see photos of young adults and their grades littered across mall banners, bus ads and building displays in Singapore. Great marketing, not healthy for society.</p>

<h4 id="how-is-the-industry-regulated">How is the industry regulated?</h4>

<p>Both Hong Kong and Singapore have regulations in place regarding tuition centers to ensure quality education and safeguard the interests of students.</p>

<p>In Hong Kong, tuition centers are governed by the Education Bureau (EDB) and are required to register with the government. The Education Ordinance sets out guidelines for tuition centers, including requirements for proper facilities, qualified teachers, and adherence to safety regulations. The EDB conducts inspections and imposes penalties for non-compliance or operating without registration.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Singapore, tuition centers are regulated by the Ministry of Education (MOE). Tuition centers must comply with the Private Education Act and the Committee for Private Education (CPE) regulations. They need to be registered with the MOE or be exempted from registration. The MOE monitors tuition centers to ensure they meet the necessary standards, including teacher qualifications, premises safety, and appropriate pedagogical practices.</p>

<p>Both jurisdictions also have regulations in place to prevent excessive advertising and misleading claims by tuition centers. Advertisements must be accurate, transparent, and adhere to guidelines set by the respective authorities. This is to protect consumers, particularly parents and students, from false or exaggerated promises.</p>

<p>These regulations aim to maintain the quality and integrity of tuition services, ensuring that students receive effective and reliable educational support. By imposing standards on tuition centers, the authorities seek to safeguard the educational well-being of students and promote a fair and transparent learning environment.</p>

<h4 id="is-tuition-an-addiction">Is tuition an addiction?</h4>

<p>Yes. Tuition has become an addiction in many educational systems, including in Hong Kong and Singapore. The intense pressure to excel academically, coupled with the fear of falling behind, has created a culture where students and parents alike feel compelled to rely on tuition as a crutch. This addiction is fueled by the belief that extra classes and constant studying are the only pathways to success, leaving little room for personal growth, hobbies, or a balanced lifestyle. Students become dependent on the constant validation and reassurance that tuition provides, fearing that without it, they will lose their competitive edge. The addictive nature of tuition perpetuates a cycle of high expectations, stress, and burnout, ultimately undermining the intrinsic joy of learning and stifling individual creativity and curiosity.</p>

<p>My recommendation to parents is to let the kids learn through school and self study and if they are really struggling in some subjects or want a leg up in another, then explore tuition as an option. Don’t put your kids through enrichment classes every evening. Let them play, enjoy themselves and build knowledge through their own curiosity.</p>

Wahoo! Singapore’s healthcare system, renowned for its efficiency, quality, and accessibility, was put under the spotlight during the past 3 years of COVID. This post explores the distinctions between private and public healthcare in Singapore, examining factors such as cost, accessibility, and quality of care. Additionally, it delves into the remuneration of doctors in Singapore, shedding light on their earning potential and the considerations surrounding their salaries. Oh, you’ll also find out about the best hospitals and where you can find them. By understanding the dynamics of Singapore’s healthcare landscape, we gain insights into the complex interplay between private and public sectors and the compensation structures that shape the medical profession in the country. We won’t be covering insurance in-depth in this post (especially cheap health insurance). We’ll save that for another time.</p>

<h4 id="hk-vs-singapore---a-little-on-their-healthcare-systems">HK vs Singapore - a little on their healthcare systems</h4>

<p>Let’s begin with comparing these two Asian countries before we double click into Singapore. The healthcare systems in Hong Kong and Singapore are often praised for their efficiency, accessibility, and quality of care. Comparing across a few criteria -</p>

<p>Healthcare Expenditure: In terms of healthcare expenditure, Hong Kong and Singapore differ significantly. According to the World Bank, Hong Kong’s healthcare expenditure accounted for approximately 17.5% of its GDP in 2019, while Singapore’s healthcare expenditure was around 4.8% of its GDP in the same year. This substantial disparity suggests that Hong Kong allocates a higher proportion of its resources to healthcare compared to Singapore.</p>

<p>Infrastructure and Facilities: Both Hong Kong and Singapore boast well-developed healthcare infrastructures. Hong Kong features a mix of public and private hospitals, including several renowned medical centers and specialty hospitals. Singapore, on the other hand, is known for its excellent public healthcare system, with a network of public hospitals and polyclinics. Additionally, Singapore has actively promoted medical tourism, attracting patients from around the world to seek specialized treatments.</p>

<p>Healthcare Outcomes: When examining healthcare outcomes, both Hong Kong and Singapore demonstrate commendable results. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Hong Kong’s life expectancy at birth is approximately 84 years, while Singapore’s stands at around 83 years. These figures indicate that residents of both regions enjoy relatively long and healthy lives.</p>

<p>Patient Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction is a crucial aspect of healthcare delivery. In a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority in 2020, 76% of respondents expressed satisfaction with the quality of healthcare services provided. Similarly, a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in Singapore in the same year reported that 85% of patients were satisfied with the overall quality of care received. These high satisfaction rates reflect the emphasis placed on patient-centered care in both systems.</p>

<p>Challenges and Opportunities: Despite the positive aspects, both healthcare systems face challenges. In Hong Kong, long waiting times for specialist appointments and limited resources are areas of concern. In Singapore, the rising cost of healthcare and an aging population present challenges to sustainability and affordability. However, these challenges also present opportunities for continuous improvement, innovation, and policy reforms in both regions.</p>

<p>Overall, both systems are robust, advanced and managed well. If you’re deciding which country to live in, I wouldn’t use healthcare as a deciding factor.</p>

<h4 id="cost-of-healthcare">Cost of healthcare</h4>

<p>The average cost of healthcare in Singapore can vary depending on factors such as the type of medical service needed, the healthcare facility, and whether an individual is a citizen, permanent resident, or foreigner. However, it’s important to note that the healthcare system in Singapore operates on a mixed financing model, with government subsidies and insurance coverage helping to make healthcare more affordable for residents.</p>

<p>For Singapore citizens and permanent residents, a significant portion of healthcare costs is covered by government subsidies and the mandatory national health insurance scheme known as MediShield Life. MediShield Life provides basic coverage for hospitalization and selected outpatient treatments.</p>

<p>That being said, there may still be out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles, co-payments, and non-subsidized services. The specific costs can vary widely based on factors like the complexity of the medical procedure, the ward class chosen (e.g., public hospital A ward, B1 ward, etc.), and the specific healthcare provider.</p>

<p>For foreigners or individuals without permanent residency in Singapore, the cost of healthcare can be higher (significantly). They are generally not eligible for government subsidies and may need to rely on private insurance or self-payment for medical expenses. Private healthcare providers in Singapore often have their own pricing structures, which can vary significantly. All that being said, expats are most likely covered by private insurance from the company, with most being top-class. My company’s insurance covers $500 USD worth of eyeglasses every year. You just can’t complain. Insurance for expats in Singapore if out of pocket is expensive, but we’ll save that for another time.</p>

<h4 id="service-providers">Service providers</h4>

<p>Public Singapore hospitals form the backbone for most of the country. Whilst the wait for public hospitals is generally much longer, the quality of them is top notch in Singapore. These hospitals provide high-quality medical services to cater to the healthcare needs of both local residents and international patients. Here are some features of public hospitals in Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High-quality medical services: Singapore’s public hospitals have modern facilities and advanced medical technology to deliver excellent healthcare services. These hospitals have top-notch medical experts and nursing staff dedicated to the treatment and care of patients (comparable to private)</li>
  <li>Wide range of specialized healthcare: Singapore’s public hospitals cover various specialized fields, including internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, cardiology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and more. Whether it’s routine health check-ups or complex surgeries, these hospitals provide comprehensive specialized medical services.</li>
  <li>Medical technology and innovation: Singapore’s public hospitals are committed to driving medical technology innovation and application. These hospitals adopt advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies, including medical imaging, surgical robotics, genetic testing, precision medicine, and more, to provide more accurate and effective healthcare.</li>
  <li>Medical research and education: Public hospitals in Singapore collaborate closely with academic and research institutions to advance medical research and education. These hospitals constantly strive to enhance the level of healthcare and service quality through scientific research and the exchange of medical knowledge.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive healthcare services: Singapore’s public hospitals offer comprehensive healthcare services, including preventive care, health screenings, chronic disease management, and rehabilitation care. These hospitals are committed to maintaining people’s overall health and provide various preventive measures and health promotion activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, public hospitals in Singapore provide top-quality medical services, advanced technology, and a wide range of specialized healthcare. They prioritize patient care and continuously contribute to medical research and education. These hospitals play a crucial role in ensuring the well-being and health of the population in Singapore.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the popular public hospitals</p>
<ul>
  <li>Singapore General Hospital (SGH): SGH is the largest and oldest public hospital in Singapore. It offers a comprehensive range of medical services and specialties, including general medicine, surgery, cardiology, oncology, and more.</li>
  <li>National University Hospital (NUH): NUH is a tertiary hospital linked to the National University of Singapore. It provides specialized medical care in various areas, including cardiology, orthopedics, neurology, and pediatrics.</li>

</ul>

<p>Others include Alexandra hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), national university hospital and woodlands hospital. When looking for a hospital, remember to see what’s your nearest hospital and the hospital visiting hours.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-polyclinics">What are polyclinics?</h4>
<p>Polyclinics in Singapore are primary healthcare facilities that provide a range of general medical services to the public. These clinics are operated by the National Healthcare Group (NHG) and SingHealth, two major healthcare clusters in Singapore. Polyclinics aim to offer accessible and affordable healthcare services to Singaporean residents.</p>

<p>Here are some key features and services provided by polyclinics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General Medical Services: Polyclinics offer general outpatient services such as consultations, examinations, diagnosis, and treatment for common medical conditions. They are staffed by a team of general practitioners (GPs) who provide primary healthcare.</li>
  <li>Chronic Disease Management: Polyclinics play a vital role in managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and others. They provide regular monitoring, health education, and medication management to help patients manage their conditions effectively.</li>
  <li>Health Screening: Polyclinics offer health screening programs that cover various age groups and specific health concerns. These screenings help detect and prevent potential health problems at an early stage.</li>
  <li>Dental Services: Many polyclinics have dental clinics that provide basic dental services like check-ups, scaling, polishing, and extractions.</li>
  <li>Health Promotion and Education: Polyclinics conduct health promotion activities and provide education on preventive measures, healthy lifestyle practices, and disease management.</li>
  <li>Allied Health Services: Some polyclinics have allied health professionals such as dietitians, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists who offer specialized services to support patient care.</li>
</ul>

<p>Polyclinics in Singapore operate on an appointment-based system, although walk-in consultations may be available for urgent cases. The fees charged at polyclinics are subsidized for Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, making healthcare services more affordable. Patients can also use their national health insurance, MediSave, to pay for eligible services at polyclinics. Polyclinics serve as an essential component of Singapore’s primary healthcare system, providing accessible and comprehensive care to the community.</p>

<h3 id="on-to-private-hospitals">On to private hospitals</h3>

<h4 id="why-go-private">Why go private?</h4>

<p>There are several reasons why individuals might choose to go to private hospitals instead of public hospitals in Singapore. Here are some possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shorter waiting times: Private hospitals generally have shorter waiting times for consultations, treatments, and surgeries compared to public hospitals. This can be appealing for individuals who prefer quicker access to medical services.</li>
  <li>More personalized care: Private hospitals often provide a more personalized and luxurious healthcare experience. They may offer amenities such as private rooms, personalized attention from medical staff, and a greater focus on patient comfort and convenience.</li>
  <li>Access to specific doctors or specialists: Private hospitals may have a wider selection of doctors and specialists who may be renowned in their respective fields. Patients who have specific preferences or seek specialized care from a particular doctor may opt for private hospitals to access their preferred healthcare providers.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health screening packages: Private hospitals often offer comprehensive health screening packages that cater to individuals who prioritize preventive care and regular health check-ups. These packages may include a wide range of tests and examinations to assess overall health and detect potential health issues at an early stage.</li>
  <li>Greater flexibility and choice: Private hospitals provide individuals with more flexibility and choice in terms of appointment scheduling, treatment options, and hospital preferences. Patients may have more control over their healthcare decisions and the ability to tailor their treatment experience according to their preferences.</li>
  <li>Availability of alternative therapies: Private hospitals may offer a broader range of alternative therapies and complementary medicine options that are not typically available in public hospitals. This can attract individuals who prefer a more holistic approach to healthcare. We’ll cover Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) another time, but that’s also a huge industry in Singapore.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="popular-private-hospitals">Popular private hospitals</h4>
<p>Here are some notable private hospitals in Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mount Elizabeth Hospital: Mount Elizabeth Hospital is one of the largest private hospitals in Singapore. It has two branches, Mount Elizabeth Orchard and Mount Elizabeth Novena, and offers a comprehensive range of medical specialties and advanced treatment options. This is part of the Parkway Health Group.</li>
  <li>Gleneagles Hospital: Gleneagles Hospital is a renowned private hospital in Singapore known for its high-quality healthcare services. It provides specialized care in areas such as cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, and women’s health. This is also part of the Parkway Health Group</li>
  <li>Raffles Hospital: Raffles Hospital is a leading private hospital that offers a wide range of medical services and specialties. It is known for its advanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities and provides personalized and holistic healthcare.</li>
  <li>Thomson Medical Centre: Thomson Medical Centre is a private hospital that specializes in women’s and children’s healthcare. It offers a comprehensive range of obstetrics, gynecology, and pediatric services.</li>
  <li>Parkway East Hospital: Parkway East Hospital is a private general acute care hospital located in the eastern part of Singapore. It provides a broad range of medical services, including surgery, internal medicine, and specialized outpatient care.</li>
</ul>

<p>My humnble opinion of what’s best - I’ve spent a long time at Raffles and recently moved over to Gleneagles / Mount E. Whilst Raffles doctors are fantastic, I struggle with their nurses, booking systems that surprisingly don’t communicate much with each other and insurance expenses (despite having the best medical insurance policy in Singapore). P.S., their health checks all suck.</p>

<h4 id="private-versus-public-comparison">Private versus public comparison</h4>

<p>Whilst these are just approximates, here are cost ranges for healthcare services in Singapore, comparing public and private sectors:</p>

<p><u> Consultation fees <u></u></u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Public healthcare: GP consultation fees range from SGD 20 to SGD 50.</li>
  <li>Private healthcare: GP consultation fees can range from SGD 50 to SGD 150 or more.</li>
</ul>

<p><u> Hospitalization costs (per day) <u></u></u></p>

<p>Public healthcare:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Class B2 ward (shared room): SGD 200 to SGD 400.</li>
  <li>Class B1 ward (semi-private room): SGD 500 to SGD 800.</li>
  <li>Class A ward (single room): SGD 800 to SGD 2,000 or more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Private healthcare: Hospitalization costs can range from SGD 1,000 to SGD 3,000 or more, depending on the ward type and hospital.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Outpatient services and treatments:</li>
  <li>Public healthcare: Diagnostic tests and procedures may have subsidized rates, varying depending on the specific service.</li>
  <li>Private healthcare: Diagnostic tests and procedures in private clinics or specialist centers can range from SGD 100 to SGD 500 or more, depending on the test or procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Medications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Public healthcare: Medications in public hospitals are typically available at subsidized rates, with prices varying based on the specific medication.</li>
  <li>Private healthcare: Medication costs in private healthcare settings can vary significantly depending on the medication and the pharmacy. Branded or specialized medications may be more expensive.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="singapore-absolutely-crushed-the-pandemic">Singapore absolutely crushed the pandemic</h4>

<p>Singapore has been widely recognized for its effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government implemented a comprehensive and proactive approach to control the spread of the virus and protect public health. Here are some key measures and strategies employed by Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Early Response and Preparedness: Singapore responded swiftly to the outbreak by establishing a multi-ministry task force and implementing a range of preventive measures even before the first local cases were reported. This included border controls, contact tracing, quarantine measures, and public communication campaigns.</li>
  <li>Robust Testing and Contact Tracing: Singapore implemented widespread testing to identify and isolate infected individuals. Contact tracing efforts were intensified through the use of technology, such as the + TraceTogether mobile app, which helped identify and notify close contacts of confirmed cases.</li>
  <li>Stringent Quarantine and Isolation Measures: Infected individuals and close contacts were required to undergo mandatory quarantine or isolation in dedicated facilities or at home. Strict enforcement and monitoring were in place to ensure compliance.</li>
  <li>Public Health Measures: Singapore implemented various public health measures such as mask-wearing, safe distancing, and regular hand hygiene. These measures were communicated to the public through extensive public education campaigns.</li>
  <li>Effective Healthcare System: Singapore’s healthcare system, with its strong infrastructure and capacity, played a crucial role in managing the pandemic. The government worked closely with healthcare institutions to increase testing capabilities, hospital capacity, and ensure sufficient resources for patient care.</li>
  <li>Clear Communication and Public Engagement: Regular updates and clear communication from government authorities helped to keep the public informed and educated about the evolving situation. Public engagement and adherence to guidelines were emphasized to foster a collective responsibility in managing the pandemic.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="given-the-healthcare-system-is-so-robust-how-much-are-doctors-being-paid">Given the healthcare system is so robust, how much are doctors being paid?</h4>

<p>You’ll be surprised with this one.</p>

<p>1st year doctor pay in USD</p>
<ul>
  <li>SG: $3400</li>
  <li>HK: $10K</li>
  <li>US: $5400</li>
</ul>

<p>Median gross monthly salary for Singapore fresh graduates is $3.1K USD. (source - Strait times). It baffles me how little these first year doctors earn. For context, a fresh non-tech grad at Google in the US earns $8000 working 40 hours a week. Singapore first year doctors work at least 60% more hours.</p>

<p>I personally know 1st year doctors who were thrown into COVID wards, and whilst there was overall fear, the resounding message was the government is in control. All that being said, they were awarded with medals (versus any sort of monetary reward) for their service. I understand doctors are here to serve the public but it’d be nice for them to be compensated.</p>

<h4 id="no-wonder-theres-a-shortage-on-doctors">No wonder there’s a shortage on doctors…</h4>

<p>What’s interesting now is that there’s a shortage of doctors. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Singapore has been experiencing a relative shortage of doctors in certain specialties and settings. While Singapore has a well-established healthcare system and a sufficient number of doctors overall, there are specific areas that face challenges in terms of doctor availability.</p>

<p>One area of concern is the demand for specialized medical professionals, such as oncologists, cardiologists, and psychiatrists, which has been growing due to an aging population and increased healthcare needs. Additionally, some rural or remote areas in Singapore may have difficulty attracting doctors, leading to a disparity in healthcare access.</p>

<p>To address this, the Singaporean government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of doctors. These efforts include expanding medical education capacity, attracting foreign doctors, and offering scholarships and incentives to encourage medical students to specialize in needed fields.
It’s important to note that the situation may have evolved since my last update, and it’s recommended to refer to recent reports and studies for the most accurate and up-to-date information on the current doctor shortage in Singapore. Please increase pay for public doctors.</p>

<p>The healthcare system in Singapore is undeniably a privilege. With its efficient, high-quality, and accessible healthcare services, supported by well-funded public hospitals, advanced medical technology, and government subsidies, Singaporeans are fortunate to have comprehensive healthcare coverage that is the envy of many nations. The ability to receive top-notch medical care without significant financial burden truly makes Singapore’s healthcare system a valuable privilege for its expats and citizens.</p>

Wahoo! Singapore’s healthcare system, renowned for its efficiency, quality, and accessibility, was put under the spotlight during the past 3 years of COVID. This post explores the distinctions between private and public healthcare in Singapore, examining factors such as cost, accessibility, and quality of care. Additionally, it delves into the remuneration of doctors in Singapore, shedding light on their earning potential and the considerations surrounding their salaries. Oh, you’ll also find out about the best hospitals and where you can find them. By understanding the dynamics of Singapore’s healthcare landscape, we gain insights into the complex interplay between private and public sectors and the compensation structures that shape the medical profession in the country. We won’t be covering insurance in-depth in this post (especially cheap health insurance). We’ll save that for another time.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/images/supportsystems.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/images/supportsystems.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hong Kong versus Singapore: same food items, different taste</title><link href="/hk-versus-sg-food/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hong Kong versus Singapore: same food items, different taste" /><published>2023-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/hk-versus-sg-food</id><content type="html" xml:base="/hk-versus-sg-food/"><![CDATA[<p>When I first arrived in Singapore, I recall ordering barbecue pork rice at a hawker center, thinking it would taste like the same comforting dish I had in Hong Kong. However, after receiving my plate of food, I found the dish surprisingly different.

In today’s post, we’ll dissect some iconic differences between Hong Kong Chinese cuisine versus Singapore Chinese cuisine.

<h4 id="history-behind-hong-kong-versus-singapore-chinese-cuisine">History behind Hong Kong versus Singapore Chinese cuisine</h4>

<p>Chinese cuisine is renowned worldwide for its rich flavors, diverse ingredients, and culinary traditions that have evolved over centuries. Two prominent centers of Chinese culinary excellence are Hong Kong and Singapore. Both regions boast a vibrant and distinct Chinese food culture that reflects their unique historical, cultural, and geographical contexts.</p>

<p>Chinese immigrants began settling in Hong Kong during the early colonial period, bringing their culinary traditions with them. Hong Kong’s cuisine is heavily influenced by Cantonese culinary traditions, renowned for its finesse, subtle flavors, and emphasis on fresh ingredients. It stands out with its delicate cooking techniques, preserving the natural taste and texture of ingredients. The cuisine showcases a wide range of ingredients, including seafood, poultry, and exotic delicacies, creating a harmonious balance of flavors and textures. Light seasonings, such as soy sauce and fermented ingredients, enhance the natural flavors without overpowering them. Simply exquisite.</p>

<p>Chinese cuisine entered Singapore through a combination of historical factors, migration, and cultural exchanges. Chinese immigrants from various regions, such as Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan, brought their culinary traditions when they settled in Singapore. Additionally, Singapore has developed its own blend of Chinese cuisine, infused with Malay, Indian, and Peranakan influences. Hence, the cuisine incorporates an additional array of herbs, spices, and sauces in their dishes.</p>

<h4 id="lets-start-off-with-seasoning-behind-the-two-cuisines">Let’s start off with seasoning behind the two cuisines</h4>

<p>When my parents visited Singapore two years back, they commented that ‘Singapore Chinese food is like Hong Kong Chinese food 25 years back. Oilier, saltier, heavier, bolder and more fragrant.’ Basically, more flavourful. A couple of things that I notice from hawker centers that may be surprising to Hong Kong visitors or expats -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jalapenos - everybody asks for Jalapenos. These are green chilis that are pickled and sliced and go well with any noodle or rice based dish. I love the pickled jalapenos in Singapore as they add a burst of flavour to your meal</li>
  <li>Chili - everybody asks for Chili. By chili, we mean this as something like 豆瓣醬 without the fermented bean paste in. Think something similar to Lao gan ma without the additional crispiness. Singaporeans love their spice and chili adds an extra dimension to the dish. To be fair, this is something you’ll also find in Hong Kong Cha Chaan Tengs</li>
  <li>Gravy - aka more sauce. This can be curry if you’re eating a Hainan curry rice, or more 勾芡 (mostly chicken soup thickened by starch) on a rice noodle dish. Locals love their gravy and often ask for their dishes to be drenched in it. Not the most refined approach but hey, people are saucy. I much prefer a moderate amount instead of having food all slathered by sauce</li>
  <li>Soy sauce - it’s not uncommon to see soy sauce in a tub or little bag with diced up red chilis inside. Be it with soup noodles or rice, people want their soy sauce to their dish. It’s horrible for your sodium levels but the takeaway is Singaporeans love their bold flavours</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="same-same-but-different-food-dishes">Same same but different food dishes</h4>

<p>On to food dishes that share the same name but are executed differently.</p>

<p><u> Carrot cake (蘿蔔糕) <u></u></u></p>

<p>Hong Kong’ers are familiar with our usual rectangular block carrot cakes that we get at the usual dim sum establishments. Singapore carrot cake is different. Singapore carrot cake, or chai tow kway, differs from Hong Kong carrot cake in both preparation and flavor. Singapore carrot cake is stir-fried and made with cubes of radish cake, resulting in a soft yet slightly crispy texture. It is seasoned with a combination of sauces, including soy sauce and oyster sauce, and often spiced up with chili paste. On the other hand, Hong Kong carrot cake is steamed, sliced, and then pan-fried, offering a firmer texture and a subtle sweet and savory taste. The two versions showcase distinct cooking methods and flavor profiles, highlighting the diverse culinary variations within Chinese cuisine.</p>

      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Radish and flour cubes pressed and fried together with egg and scallions</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p><u> Barbeque pork (叉燒) <u></u></u></p>

<p>Let me be clear here. There’s some damn good cha siu in Singapore. I’ve talked about Jiang Nan Chun before for traditional cha siu, and Fook Kin is another one of my favourites for a more modern twist to cha siu. All that being said, if you visit a generic hawker store i.e. to a wanton chasiu noodle store, the cha siu you will get will differ from an ingredient selection standpoint and a technique standpoint.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thinly sliced versus thickly sliced</li>
  <li>Leaner versus fattier</li>
  <li>Dyed artificially red</li>
  <li>No honey glaze</li>
  <li>Rice will be drenched with soy sauce</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty much, the Singapore version is a more stripped down version of the Hong Kong iteration given slimmer margins of operations as well. If you are from Hong Kong, you will notice the difference versus a HK barbeque meat (燒臘) shop. The same applies to pork belly. A much thinner and leaner cut.</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Fook Kin. The thick cut slices that you usually find in Hong Kongd</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><u> Fried Rice (炒飯) <u></u></u></p>

<p>If we want to be more specific, let’s compare yangzhou fried rice (揚州炒飯). Yangzhou fried rice is a flavorful Chinese dish made with ingredients such as diced cha siu, shrimp, eggs, carrots, peas, and green onions. The ingredients are stir-fried together with soy sauce, oyster sauce, and seasonings. At least that’s what we’re familiar with in Hong Kong. In Singapore. In Singapore, a lot of the core ingredients are stripped away. Again, an adaptation to maintain margins given prices are so much cheaper in Singapore. You’re usually left with tiny pieces of cha siu, scallions and eggs. This is not a critique to the dish itself, but just a heads up of the differences. All that being said, wok hey is still there and taste is just fine.</p>

<p><u> Congee <u></u></u></p>

<p>Singapore congee, often known as “bubur,” features a rich and thick consistency with a wide range of ingredients. It is typically cooked with long-grain rice and a variety of meats, such as chicken, pork, or seafood. Singaporean-style congee incorporates various herbs, spices, and condiments to enhance the flavor, such as ginger, garlic, fried shallots, and soy sauce. The result is a flavorful and hearty porridge, often served with additional toppings like century eggs, sliced spring onions, and crispy fried dough fritters (you tiao). In contrast, Hong Kong congee, also known as “jook,” tends to have a smoother and silkier texture. It is traditionally made with short-grain rice, which creates a softer consistency. Hong Kong-style congee is typically simpler in terms of ingredients, often featuring just a few key components such as lean pork or fish. The focus is on the delicate and subtle flavors of the main ingredient, allowing the natural taste of the rice and meat to shine.</p>

<p>It fascinates me how these basic dishes all have their own local twists to it. They’re all delicious too.</p>

<h4 id="a-little-on-dining-know-hows">A little on dining know-hows</h4>

<p>Small little things on dining know-hows caught my attention after visiting hawker centers a few times.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water / tea is not free: It usually is for a cha chaan teng but not in a coffee shop / hawker center in Singapore</li>
  <li>You have to busk: Saves labour cost especially in community eateries
Portion size flexibility: You have the ability to select your meal size. Small rice? $4. Medium rice? $4.5. Large rice? $5</li>
  <li>Plastic bags for drinks: Drinking coffee? Have it in a plastic bag. Obviously, it’s a plastic bag tailored for a drink and you stick a straw through it but it’s definitely old school</li>
  <li>Wet towels / tissue: Bring your own. If you dine in a coffee shop and they have a wet wipe, it’ll most likely cost you money</li>
</ul>
