But there’s one more thing that’s constant in Singapore - its tropical climate. Located just a stone’s throw from the equator, Singapore experiences warm weather all year round, interspersed with sudden bursts of rainfall. In this blog post, we’ll explore Singapore’s climate and weather patterns, and how it shapes the daily lives of its residents. Whether you’re a new resident, a long-time local, or a potential tourist, this guide will help you understand and navigate Singapore’s unique weather conditions. So, let’s dive right in!</p>

<h4 id="what-is-singapores-weather-and-why-is-it-the-way-it-is">What is singapore’s weather and why is it the way it is</h4>

<p>Singapore is located 137 kilometers north of the Equator and does not experience the four traditional seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Instead, it has a tropical rainforest climate with no significant changes in temperature due to the proximity to the equator.</p>

<p>Singapore experiences a relatively uniform temperature, humidity, and precipitation throughout the year. The uniform temperature is a result of the city-state’s maritime exposure, which moderates the heat. However, the high humidity can make the actual temperature feel hotter than it is. This ‘feels-like’ temperature, factoring in the humidity, can reach up to 34°C (93°F) in the daytime.</p>

<p>While rainfall is a common occurrence throughout the year, the intensity of the rainfall varies. Singapore experiences two monsoon seasons - the Northeast Monsoon from December to early March, and the Southwest Monsoon from June to September. During these periods, rainfall is more frequent and intense with thunderstorms commonly occurring in the late afternoon and early evening.</p>

<p>Despite the generally high humidity and rainfall, Singapore gets plenty of sunshine. It’s sunny approximately 50% of the time during daylight hours, equating to about 12 hours of sunlight per day, as the country is located near the Equator.
Singapore’s weather can be quite unpredictable. Even on a sunny day, rain showers can suddenly occur, often brief but heavy. Therefore, it is always advisable for both residents and visitors to be prepared with an umbrella or raincoat when heading outdoors.</p>

<p>Overall, the climate in Singapore is warm and humid throughout the year, characterized by abundant rainfall and a significant amount of sunshine.</p>

<h4 id="how-best-to-adapt-for-singapore-weather">How best to adapt for singapore weather</h4>

<p>Here are some tips to best prepare for Singapore’s weather as a tourist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Light Clothing: Singapore’s weather is hot and humid throughout the year, with temperatures usually between 25°C to 33°C. Light, breathable clothing is recommended. Cotton t-shirts, shorts, skirts, or light trousers are ideal.</li>
  <li>Sun Protection: Due to Singapore’s equatorial location, the sun can be quite strong. Sunscreen with a high SPF, sunglasses, and a hat or umbrella for sun protection are must-haves when venturing out during the day.</li>
  <li>Stay Hydrated: The humidity can make you sweat more than usual, so it’s important to keep hydrated. Always carry a water bottle with you and drink frequently.</li>
  <li>Umbrella or Raincoat: Rain showers can happen frequently and unexpectedly due to the tropical rainforest climate, so it’s a good idea to carry an umbrella or a small, packable raincoat.</li>
  <li>Comfortable Footwear: You’ll likely be walking a lot as a tourist, and combined with the hot weather, comfortable footwear is essential. Opt for breathable, comfortable shoes or sandals.</li>
  <li>Air-Conditioned Places: Plan some indoor activities as well. Singapore has many museums, shopping malls, and restaurants where you can escape the heat.</li>
  <li>Adaptation Time: Give yourself time to adapt to the hot and humid climate, especially if you’re from a cooler country. Take it easy for the first few days.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to check the weather forecast often, as it can change rapidly. Despite the heat and humidity, you’ll find that the weather won’t be a barrier to enjoying what Singapore has to offer.</p>

<h4 id="secret-way-of-tracking-singapore-weather">Secret way of tracking singapore weather</h4>

<p>There’s no ‘secret’ way to track Singapore’s weather, but there are several reliable sources and methods to keep updated:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS): The MSS website provides real-time weather updates, forecasts, and other meteorological information about Singapore.</li>
  <li>Weather Apps: Numerous weather apps, such as Weather@SG, AccuWeather, or the Weather Channel, provide real-time updates and forecasts. Remember to set your location to Singapore for accurate information.</li>
  <li>National Environment Agency (NEA): NEA’s website also monitors and provides updates about Singapore’s weather. They also have a mobile app that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts.</li>
  <li>News Channels: Local news channels in Singapore often provide weather forecasts and updates, especially during news broadcasts.</li>
  <li>Social Media: Some weather agencies and meteorological services have social media accounts where they post regular updates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, Singapore’s weather can change quickly, so it’s a good idea to check the forecast regularly throughout the day. Google weather’s decent but NEA is always the best.</p>

<h4 id="where-can-you-find-cold-weather-in-singapore">Where can you find cold weather in singapore</h4>

<p>In Singapore, which is a tropical country, cold weather is not naturally occurring. However, there are several places where you can experience colder temperatures (not really…).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shopping Malls: Singapore’s shopping malls, which have become an integral part of the urban landscape, are usually air-conditioned and can be quite cold. Some of the best shopping malls in Singapore are Ion Orchard, Vivocity, and Bugis Junction</li>
  <li>Switching on the Aircon: At home or in the office, turning on the air conditioning can create a colder environment</li>
  <li>Getting out of the country: Self-explanatory</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, Singapore’s weather is known for its tropical rainforest climate, with high temperatures and humidity all year round. The rainy season mainly occurs from November to January, but it can rain at any time of the year. Singapore’s weather changes rapidly, so both locals and tourists need to keep a close eye on weather forecasts. Fortunately, there are various tools and methods to track Singapore’s weather, including the website of the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS), weather apps, and the website and apps of the National Environment Agency (NEA).

Join us as we delve into the lap of luxury, exploring a curated selection of the city-state’s most exquisite hotels, each boasting its unique charm and allure. Oh, and learn more about how you can snag a great hotel deal.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-hotels-so-expensive-in-singapore">Why are hotels so expensive in Singapore</h4>

<p>Several factors contribute to the high cost of hotels in Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limited Space and High Demand: Singapore is a small island nation with limited land space. The demand for accommodation, both for business and tourism, often exceeds the available supply, driving up prices</li>
  <li>Economic Prosperity: Singapore is a global financial hub and a major business destination in Asia. The city attracts a high number of business travelers, expatriates, and tourists seeking luxury experiences. The strong economy contributes to a higher overall cost of living, including hotel prices</li>
  <li>Luxury Tourism Market: Singapore has positioned itself as a luxury travel destination, offering high-end shopping, dining, and entertainment. Many hotels in Singapore cater to the luxury tourism market, providing premium services, amenities, and experiences, which naturally come at a higher cost</li>
  <li>Operational Costs: The cost of doing business in Singapore is relatively high. Labor costs, real estate prices, and operational expenses for maintaining high standards in facilities and services contribute to the overall cost of running hotels</li>
  <li>Strategic Location: Singapore’s strategic location in Southeast Asia makes it a hub for international travel. Hotels in prime locations, especially those with easy access to business districts, shopping areas, and tourist attractions, tend to command higher prices</li>
  <li>Strict Regulations and Standards: Singapore has stringent regulations and high standards for safety, cleanliness, and service quality in the hospitality industry. Meeting and maintaining these standards require significant investment, which is reflected in the pricing of hotel rooms</li>
  <li>Tourist Taxes and Fees: Singapore imposes taxes and fees on hotel stays, contributing to the overall cost. Additionally, hotels often include service charges and other fees in their pricing structure</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-i-look-for-in-quality-hotels">What I look for in quality hotels</h4>

<p>When embarking on a journey and choosing a hotel, certain personal touches can make all the difference. Here’s a heartfelt guide to ensuring your stay is not just accommodation but an experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location: Seek a haven that resonates with your vibe, be it nestled near vibrant attractions, in the heart of business districts, or serenely close to nature</li>
  <li>Amenities and Services: Elevate your stay with hotels that understand your desires — whether it’s unwinding in a spa, staying connected with seamless Wi-Fi, or breaking a sweat in a well-equipped gym</li>
  <li>Room Quality: Your personal sanctuary should boast not just cleanliness but a cozy ambiance, modern conveniences, and perhaps a breathtaking view to make every moment memorable</li>
  <li>Hotel Reputation: Trust in the legacy of renowned hotels; their reputation is a testament to the enduring commitment to hospitality and guest satisfaction</li>
  <li>Loyalty Program: Consider hotels that reward your loyalty, transforming your visits into a series of cherished experiences and exclusive perks</li>
  <li>Price: While mindful of your budget, view the cost as an investment in a curated experience rather than a mere transaction</li>
  <li>Accessibility: Consider your unique needs, ensuring the hotel is not just a place to stay but one that seamlessly accommodates your journey, regardless of mobility requirements</li>

<h4 id="how-to-snag-a-good-hotel-deal">How to snag a good hotel deal</h4>

<p>Snagging good hotel deals requires a bit of savvy and strategic planning. Here are some tips, including using corporate codes:
Comparison Sites: Use hotel comparison websites like Booking.com, Expedia, or Hotels.com to compare prices across various platforms.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Timing is Key: Book during off-peak seasons or last-minute for potential discounts. Hotels often drop prices to fill vacant rooms.</li>
  <li>Sign Up for Alerts: Subscribe to newsletters or set up price alerts on travel websites. They notify you when prices drop for your chosen hotels.</li>
  <li>Loyalty Programs: Join hotel loyalty programs. Members often get exclusive discounts, perks, or room upgrades.</li>
  <li>Corporate Codes: Perhaps the most important one. Some companies have corporate codes for hotel discounts. These can sometimes be found online through forums or by directly reaching out to the company’s HR department. Remember to read the terms and conditions carefully, and be cautious when using corporate codes to ensure compliance with hotel policies.
    <ul>
      <li>Bundle Deals: Consider booking flight and hotel together. Bundling can sometimes result in significant savings.</li>
      <li>Use Apps: Check hotel booking apps for exclusive mobile deals or app-only discounts.</li>
      <li>Flexible Dates: If your travel dates are flexible, use tools that show you the cheapest days to stay.</li>
      <li>Book Directly: Sometimes, hotels offer the best rates when you book directly through their websites. If other competitors are offering a cheaper price, call the hotel directly and ask for a price match or extra benefits. It always works</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Let’s take a delightful journey through the history and cultural impact of this beloved café, where tradition meets the aromatic allure of freshly brewed coffee. Then, I’ll reveal my go-to options at this establishment. Let’s get started.</p>

<h4 id="history-of-toast-box">History of toast box</h4>

<p>Conceived by the visionary minds at BreadTalk Group, Toast Box emerged with a mission to recreate the ambiance and flavors of the traditional kopitiams that were once the heartbeat of Singapore. Unlike Ya Kun / Yakun toast which started as a coffee stall in 1944, Toast Box is a more recent creation. The first Toast Box café opened its doors in 2005, breathing life into a concept that would soon become synonymous with nostalgic charm and authentic Singaporean breakfast. Well-played BreadTalk Group.
What sets Toast Box apart is its commitment to preserving the rich heritage of local coffee culture. Stepping into a Toast Box outlet is like stepping back in time, with its retro décor and the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee filling the air. The café’s design reflects the aesthetics of traditional kopitiams, creating a nostalgic haven for locals and a delightful discovery for tourists.</p>

<p>Fueled by the warmth of its kopi and the irresistible aroma of its toasts, Toast Box quickly gained popularity. Its success transcended the borders of Singapore, leading to international expansion. Today, Toast Box is not just a local gem but also an ambassador of Singaporean breakfast culture, with outlets in various international locations.
Toast Box has played a pivotal role in fostering an appreciation for Singapore’s coffee culture. It has become more than just a place to savor a cup of kopi; it’s a cultural touchstone where locals gather for a taste of tradition, and tourists seek an authentic experience.</p>

<p>While Toast Box remains deeply rooted in tradition, it has not shied away from evolution. The café has adapted to changing consumer preferences, introducing new menu items without compromising the authenticity that defines its identity. It strikes a delicate balance between preserving the past and embracing the present.</p>

I’ve always considered myself someone with a refined palate, and I’ve never quite found satisfaction in the recommendations from Google Maps, local Singaporeans, or local food blogs and YouTube channels. Therefore, I’ve made the decision to curate my own list for all you epicureans out there.</p>

<h4 id="some-ground-rules">Some ground rules</h4>

<p>As a reminder, this isn’t a fine dining list for 2 reasons - 1) it’s quite challenging to categorize the types of cuisine it covers, and 2) fine dining is never really a go-to option for food for anyone. I’ll share my list of fine dining recommendations at a later day. Additionally, we’ll exclude ‘Singaporean cuisine’ from this list as it deserves its own spotlight at another time. For certain cuisines, I don’t have a go-to choice as I don’t often have cravings for them. This includes Indian, Peranakan, Mala, etc., so they will also be omitted. These recommendations span across various price points. Keep in mind that this is my personal go-to list when I have specific cravings for a particular cuisine. If you have any recommendations, feel free to share them with me! I’d love to know your go-to places as well.</p>

<h5 id="western">Western</h5>

<p><u>Italian<u></u></u></p>

<p>Many italian restaurants are across the island. Most are tasty but way over price. Below are the ones that I find are value</p>

<ul>
  <li>No Menu ($$$): Experience authentic Italian cuisine complemented by excellent service and ambiance. True to its name, you can request dishes not listed on the menu. I personally recommend trying their seafood risotto and lobster ravioli.</li>
  <li>Publico ($$): A vibrant al fresco restaurant situated in the heart of Robertson Quay, perfect for brunch enthusiasts. I’m a fan of their shakshuka and pasta dishes. It’s an ideal spot for a mid-day drink.</li>
  <li>Pasta Bar ($$$): Indulge in high-quality, fresh pasta dishes in the heart of the city. This is my top choice for seafood pasta in Singapore, thanks to their exceptionally fresh ingredients and al dente pasta</li>
  <li>Ristorante Takada ($$$): Italian Japanese fusion. High value</li>
</ul>

      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Ristorante Takada’s signature uni pasta - incredible umami</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><u>Mediterranean<u></u></u></p>

<p>Mediterranean is not the most common in Singapore but for the establishments below, they execute on their respective dishes well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blu Kouzina ($$$): Renowned Mediterranean restaurant in Singapore known for its authentic dishes inspired by Greece, Turkey, and Lebanon. They emphasize high-quality ingredients sourced from Greece, offering a warm and inviting dining experience. I love their EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) - it’s pretty much on every dish. Order their baked halloumi cheese too - it’s divine</li>
  <li>Bakalaki Greek Taverna ($$$): Less of a vibe compared to Blu Kouzina, but serves up incredible gyros and souvlakis</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/images/greek.jpg" alt="greek" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Feta salad with EVOO - an evergreen classic</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><u>Spanish<u></u></u></p>

<p>Similar to Mediterranean cuisine, Spanish food isn’t common in Singapore. The two below are absolute standouts for me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>FOC ($$$): One’s in sentosa whilst the other’s near boat quay. Master of the Josper grill. Try their Iberian pork jowl and the Josper grilled spanish octopus. Their desserts are not to be discounted.</li>
  <li>Olivia ($$$): Known for their blue cheese basque cheesecake and croquettes. Intimate and straight to the point Spanish food that transports you back to Barcelona</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Burgers<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are plenty of burger places in Singapore including popular chains. Shake shack has to be a shout out here because it is decent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Honbo ($$): Originally from Hong Kong and recently opened in Singapore. They serve up amazing smash patties with a fluffy potato milk bun, with their Double Gold American beef coming from Wisconsin</li>
  <li>Three buns ($$): As a part of the Potato Head Club, Three Buns is a popular burger joint known for its creative and delicious beef burgers. While it may not be the most budget-friendly option, the indulgent and delectable offerings make it a worthwhile culinary experience</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Steakhouse<u></u></u></p>

<p>Multiple restaurants serve steak in Singapore, but not a lot of them are steakhouses. I wouldn’t exactly call Burnt Ends a steakhouse given it does have a michelin star and is more relevated, but their steak is a definite highlight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Burnt ends (\(\)): Famous for its wood-fired cooking techniques and innovative dishes. Their signature item, the Burnt Ends Sanger, is a must-try—a flavorful sandwich featuring smoked meats and homemade pickles, served on a potato roll. Order a steak even if it’s expensive. Don’t bother with their bakery</li>
  <li>Wolfgangs (\(\)): The best steakhouse I’ve been that’s not in South America. Incredibly pricey but their steaks are perfectly charred and grilled. Portions are extremely generous. A perfect pick for a marquee celebration</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pizza<u></u></u></p>

<p>Singapore’s pizza scene is slowly growing, with a mix of American and Italian chains popping up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wild Child ($$): One of the best Neapolitan pizzas in Singapore. The dough is fluffy with a gorgeous amount of chewiness, complemented by quality ingredients. It’s known for its signature crack sauce that adds a burst of flavour to every pizza.</li>
  <li>Extra Virgin Pizza ($$): Less of a vibe than Wild Child, but there’s no doubt that their pizzas are divine. Their crusts are always beautifully charred and their innovative toppings amalgamate finely with the base</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="asian">Asian</h5>

<p><u>Taiwanese<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are quite a few Taiwanese-style restaurants, but not a lot of authentic Taiwanese food that is at the price point that it should be in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Isshin Machi ($$): My go-to Taiwanese restaurant in Singapore is Isshin Machi, with multiple locations across the island. I particularly adore their pork chop fried rice (which gives Din Tai Fung a run for its money) and their refreshing winter melon tea (not to sweet, just mellow)</li>
  <li>Abundance ($$): My old neighbourhood haunt that is massively underrated. Their gua baos, dumplings and bacon cabbage make for a perfect late night meal</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Cantonese / Dim sum<u></u></u></p>

<p>Hailing from Hong Kong, there is a long list of restaurants / dining establishments I default to. One I have to shout out is Canton Paradise. Those chain stores are decent. More on specific dim sum options in <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/dimsum/">my previous article</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legendary HK ($$): My default cha chaan teng. Huge variety of options, authentic cantonese flavours and very affordable. Their congee is divine and fluffy unlike Singaporean / Taiwanese congee</li>
  <li>So good ($$): So good has a couple of chains across the island, and whilst I prefer Legendary as my #1 cantonese haunt, So Good comes in as a close second. I’m a sucker for their breakfast and afternoon tea</li>
  <li>Wah lok: ($$) Best dim sum in SG. They don’t skimp on the ingredients, so expect plump siu mais and shrimp dumplings. Great value for money given the restaurant is situated at the Carlton hotel</li>
  <li>Fook kin ($$): Best cantonese roast that’s not fine dining or a preppy cantonese restaurant. Not 100% authentic cantonese cha siu (more of a malaysian style instead) but does a terrific job in delivering charred, tender roast meat</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Japanese<u></u></u></p>

<p>This is a weird one. There are plenty of fantastic japanese restaurants in Singapore at all price points. Unlike other cuisines, I can’t bring myself to eat high end Japanese food in Singapore as they are too criminally priced. Hence, the below are some of my more comfortable options.</p>

<p>The sushi bar: My go-to for chirashi bowls. The Sushi bar serves up generous portions at a very respectable price point. Feel free to ask them to swap out specific cuts of fish if you prefer others - I always ask for more Salmon instead of swordfish
Omote: Similar to the Sushi Bar, Omote serves up comfort japanese food. They have a branch in City Hall now so if I’m near there versus Orchard where The Sushi Bar is, I’ll pop in for a meal
Sushiro: ‘Fun’ conveyor belt sushi. Don’t hate on my recommendation but Sushiro is delightfully pleasant, with a frequent rotating menu to highlight seasonal cuts
Brothers ramen: A dining hall for many Japanese expats in Singapore. I love how clean their broth is and their ramen has the perfect amount of spring in it</p>

<p><u>Korean<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are plenty of korean food places along the Tanjong Pagar stretch, and they are all of impressive qualities. To highlight a few -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wang dae bak: Korean BBQ masterclass on top of a traditional grill. Book ahead of time as it always get filled</li>
  <li>SBCD tofu house: For hearty Sundubu jigae. Their tofu is made-in-house and is simple yet delicious</li>
  <li>Obba Jajang: MY go-to for jjajangmyeon and jjampong. Their banchan is average but I love their noodles (springy, chewy, slurpy)</li>
  <li>Magal: Versatile restaurant, with delicious BBQ options as well as jigaes (stew). Don’t skip out on their cockles rice and their gamjatang (pork bone stew)</li>
</ul>

But let’s face it, in this age of technological marvels, even the simplest tasks have evolved. Many of us have embraced the convenience of online grocery shopping, making our lives even more hassle-free. Let’s embark on a journey to uncover the top online grocery options that Singapore has to offer for all us lazy people.</p>

<h4 id="why-shop-for-groceries-online">Why shop for groceries online?</h4>

<p>TL;DR - we’re lazy. To expand -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convenience: Shop from the comfort of your home, avoiding the need to travel to physical stores, stand in lines, or carry heavy bags. Many online grocery stores operate 24/7, providing the flexibility to shop whenever it’s most convenient for you, whether that’s early in the morning or late at night</li>
  <li>Time-saving: Quickly browse and select items, eliminating the need for a time-consuming trip to the store</li>
  <li>Price comparison: Compare prices easily across different brands and products, helping you find the best deals and discounts</li>
  <li>Subscription services: Schedule recurring deliveries for essential items, ensuring you never run out of household staples</li>
  <li>Detailed product information: Online platforms provide detailed product descriptions and customer reviews, helping you make informed decisions about the products you purchase</li>
  <li>Reduced Impulse Buying: Shopping online can help you stick to your shopping list and avoid impulse purchases, ultimately saving you money</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="are-prices-better-online">Are prices better online?</h4>

<p>Yes and no. It really depends on the quantity of goods you are purchasing. Online platforms usually have discount codes and incentivize bulk buying. However, you have to factor in whether delivery fees are high (if not waived at all).</p>

<h4 id="cons-of-online-grocery-shopping">Cons of online grocery shopping</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Grocery shopping is a lifestyle: To some, grocery shopping in stores is a borderline hobby. It is for me at least. I love visiting grocery stores to see what latest products are being featured. Shopping online just isn’t the same</li>
  <li>Delivery Fees: Many online grocery platforms charge delivery fees, which can vary based on factors like the order amount, delivery time, and location. You should factor in these fees when comparing prices.</li>
  <li>Minimum Order Requirements: Some online grocery stores may require a minimum order amount to qualify for free or reduced delivery fees. Be sure to check the terms and conditions.</li>
  <li>Quality and Freshness: Some individuals prefer to select their own fresh produce and items with a specific expiration date in physical stores to ensure quality. When shopping online, you are relying on the shopper’s judgment.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-are-the-delivery-options">What are the delivery options?</h4>

<p>Let’s take a look at the top 3 grocers in Singapore - Fairprice, Sheng Shiong and Cold Storage.</p>

<p><u>FairPrice Online<u></u></u></p>
<ul>

While marriage remains a vital aspect of Singaporean culture, it’s worth examining the trends and factors that have shaped the current landscape. Heads-up, marriage is not for everyone. Some even think it’s a scam. This isn’t an article about why you should or should not get married. By all means, do whatever that works for you. However, we will discuss how marriage has been shifting in Singapore, as well as what you should look out for when taking your wedding photos. In that regard, we are here to make sure you don’t get scammed by pesky wedding photographers.</p>

<h4 id="lets-begin-with-the-shifts-in-the-marriage-landscape">Let’s begin with the shifts in the marriage landscape</h4>

<p>There has been a changing attitude towards marriage in Singapore, Marriage has traditionally been viewed as a significant life milestone in Singapore, often symbolizing stability and commitment. However, contemporary attitudes towards marriage have evolved. Many young Singaporeans are choosing to delay marriage to focus on their careers, personal growth, and financial stability. The emphasis is now on marrying for love and compatibility rather than societal expectations. Some beginning thoughts on what else is driving the shift and other phenomena that have arose from this -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declining marriage rates: Singapore has witnessed a decline in marriage rates over the past decade. Factors such as increasing educational attainment, financial independence, and changing gender roles have contributed to this trend. People are prioritizing higher education and career advancement before considering marriage, resulting in later unions</li>
  <li>Cohabitation and unmarried parenthood: Cohabitation is becoming increasingly common in Singapore. Couples are choosing to live together and build their lives before formalizing their relationships through marriage. Additionally, the stigma surrounding unmarried parenthood has diminished, with more couples choosing to start families without traditional marriage</li>
  <li>Rising age at first marriage:The average age at which Singaporeans get married has risen steadily. Many are tying the knot in their late twenties or early thirties, compared to earlier generations who often married in their early twenties. This shift is driven by the pursuit of personal goals and financial stability before taking on the responsibilities of marriage</li>
  <li>Multicultural marriages: Singapore’s multicultural society has led to an increase in intercultural and cross-border marriages. Couples from different cultural backgrounds or nationalities are coming together, enriching the country’s cultural tapestry. These marriages often involve navigating unique challenges, such as cultural differences and immigration processes
Government initiatives: The Singaporean government has recognized the evolving dynamics of marriage and family life. Policies and initiatives, such as the Marriage and Parenthood Package, aim to support couples in building strong families. These initiatives include financial incentives, parental leave, and flexible work arrangements to encourage marriage and parenthood</li>
  <li>Embracing diversity: Singapore’s evolving attitudes towards marriage reflect a broader global trend of embracing diversity in relationships and family structures. While traditional marriages remain essential, the country’s openness to various relationship choices (although LGBT marriages are still not recognized) reflects a more inclusive and accepting society.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="should-i-have-a-wedding-or-should-i-just-rom">Should I have a wedding or should I just ROM?</h4>

<p>This is an increasingly common question amongst the younger generation. ROM stands for registration of marriage (aka signing  marriage papers). For those who have a wedding, most ROM during the wedding though some ROM prior the wedding itself. There are several reasons why an increasing number of people in Singapore are opting not to have traditional weddings and just opting for ROM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cost: Weddings are expensive. Many couples find that the cost of hosting a wedding, which includes venue rental, catering, decor, and other expenses, can be a significant financial burden. As a result, some couples choose to allocate their resources differently, perhaps for a house, travel, or other financial goals</li>
  <li>Lifestyle choices: Some couples prefer to embrace a simpler and more minimalist lifestyle. They may opt for smaller, more intimate gatherings or choose alternative ways to celebrate their union that align with their values. Smaller, intimate gatherings with close family and friends are becoming increasingly popular. Couples often find that these smaller events are more meaningful and allow for deeper connections with their loved ones.</li>
  <li>Parents have less say: Parents have less influence nowadays when it comes to weddings. Weddings have traditionally been an occasion for parents to showcase and brag about their children. However, with a gradual decline in parental control over their offspring and more relaxed expectations regarding filial piety, parents find themselves with diminishing authority in orchestrating elaborate weddings</li>
  <li>Time Constraints: Planning a traditional wedding can be a time-consuming endeavor. In today’s fast-paced world, with demanding work schedules and various commitments, couples often find themselves strapped for time when it comes to organizing and carrying out a wedding. This situation often prompts them to opt for simpler alternatives. I’ve heard from numerous friends who, in hindsight, express a desire for a smaller-scale wedding or even forgo the idea of a wedding altogether. The stress associated with wedding planning, they recount, detracted from their ability to fully enjoy their own special day</li>
  <li>Cultural Shifts: Changing cultural norms and values can influence marriage choices. As societal attitudes evolve, there is less pressure to conform to traditional wedding expectations, allowing couples more flexibility in how they choose to celebrate their union</li>
  <li>COVID-19 Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted wedding plans for many couples. Restrictions on gatherings and health concerns have led some to postpone or downsize their weddings, while others have chosen to have small, intimate ceremonies. COVID officially showed the world that smaller weddings are ok!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whats-the-deal-with-destination-weddings">What’s the deal with destination weddings?</h4>

<p>Singaporeans often choose beautiful and picturesque destinations for their destination weddings. Here’s why you would do one:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scenic and unique locations: Destination weddings allow couples to tie the knot in picturesque and unique settings. From beachfront ceremonies to historic castles or tropical islands, the choice of location can be stunning and unforgettable</li>
  <li>Intimate gatherings: Many couples prefer smaller, more intimate weddings with only close family and friends. Destination weddings naturally limit the guest list, creating a more personal and meaningful experience. Don’t like an aunt or uncle? A destination wedding helps resolve this</li>
  <li>Built-In Honeymoon: Destination weddings often double as a honeymoon. Couples can seamlessly transition from the wedding festivities to their honeymoon, saving both time and money</li>
  <li>Neutral location: If the couple comes from different cultural backgrounds or has family in different locations, a destination wedding can be a way to bring everyone together and celebrate in a neutral location</li>
  <li>Reduced Stress: Destination wedding packages offered by resorts and venues often include wedding planning services. This can significantly reduce the stress associated with planning a traditional wedding</li>
  <li>Cost-Effective: In some cases, destination weddings can be more cost-effective than traditional weddings, especially when considering guest numbers and all-inclusive packages</li>
  <li>Symbolic Locations: Sometimes, couples choose a destination with personal significance, such as where they met or a place they’ve always dreamed of visiting</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some popular destination wedding locations favored by couples from Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bali, Indonesia: Bali is a top choice for destination weddings due to its stunning beaches, lush landscapes, and vibrant culture. Couples can exchange vows overlooking the Indian Ocean or in lush tropical gardens. Bali offers a range of wedding venues, from luxury resorts to private villas</li>
  <li>Phuket, Thailand: Phuket’s pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and luxurious resorts make it a sought-after destination for  weddings. Couples can have a beachfront ceremony or choose from numerous scenic venues. Thailand’s warm hospitality and exotic charm add to the appeal</li>
  <li>Santorini, Greece: Santorini’s iconic white-washed buildings, dramatic cliffs, and breathtaking sunsets create a romantic backdrop for weddings. Many couples opt for intimate ceremonies overlooking the caldera or in charming chapels</li>
  <li>Maldives: The Maldives offers a dreamy setting for beachfront weddings. Overwater bungalows, turquoise waters, and coral reefs make it a paradise for couples seeking a romantic escape and a unique wedding experience. Of course, it’s extremely expensive too</li>
  <li>Da Nang, Vietnam: A top choice given its proximity to Singapore alongside a good value for money. You’ll get amazing food and beaches similar to Bali, at a better cost</li>
</ul>

<p>These destination wedding locations offer a blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and romantic charm, making them popular choices for couples looking to create memorable and unique wedding experiences. Keep in mind that wedding planning for international destinations may involve additional logistical considerations, so it’s essential to plan ahead. I’ve been to weddings in Indonesia, Vietnam and Korea. They were all gorgeous in their own way.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-wedding-photos-so-expensive-in-singapore">Why are wedding photos so expensive in Singapore?</h4>

<p>Wedding photographs play an integral role in capturing the essence of the wedding experience. Different individuals opt for various approaches when it comes to photography. Some arrange pre-wedding photoshoots, while others focus on capturing moments on the wedding day itself. Some even choose to document their post-wedding moments. Moreover, there are options for both indoor and outdoor photoshoots, catering to individual preferences. Remarkably, the field of wedding photography has evolved into a thriving industry.</p>

<p>Wedding photography in Singapore can be relatively expensive for several reasons, and some couples opt to have their wedding photos taken abroad for cost savings and unique experiences. Let me tell you - this is the way to go. Here’s why wedding photography in Singapore can be costly and why couples consider overseas options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High Cost of Living: Singapore is known for its high cost of living, which affects various services, including wedding photography. Photographers have to cover their living expenses, equipment costs, and other overheads, leading to higher rates. This is the main reason</li>
  <li>Demand and Competition: Singapore’s wedding industry is highly competitive, with many couples vying for the best services. High demand often leads to photographers charging premium rates for their services. I would say not all photographers are quality, but given the limited supply in Singapore, rates are boosted up</li>
  <li>Customization and Packages: Photographers often offer customizable packages to meet the unique needs of each couple. These packages may include engagement sessions, pre-wedding shoots, and various album options, adding to the overall cost. Guess what? Singaporeans are needy. From the photographers I have spoken with, many said that Singaporean couples ask for more customizations versus couples of other backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-do-you-avoid-wedding-photo-traps">How do you avoid wedding photo traps?</h4>

<p>Wedding photography selection can be distressing and financially damaging. The industry is filled with red flags and predatory sales tactics. Here are some wedding photo scams to watch out for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bait-and-Switch: A photographer showcases impressive work online, but when hired, provides subpar quality photos. They may even send a different photographer to the wedding</li>
  <li>Payment Upfront: Scammers may insist on full payment or a significant deposit before the wedding day, then disappear or provide substandard services. Legitimate photographers typically require a deposit, but be cautious if the request seems excessive</li>
  <li>No Contract: A reputable photographer will always provide a detailed contract outlining services, pricing, and terms. Avoid photographers who refuse to provide or sign a contract</li>
  <li>Hidden Fees and Payment Methods: The biggest one to watch out for. Some dishonest photographers may lure clients with seemingly low upfront prices but later add hidden fees for services like editing, album creation, buying ampoules or extra hours. Be sure to clarify all potential additional costs upfront and include them in the contract to avoid surprises</li>
  <li>Payment Methods: Scammers might encourage cash payments to avoid leaving a financial trail. This can be risky because it makes it difficult to track and dispute payments if there are issues with the service. Always choose secure payment methods like credit cards, checks, or online transfers, which provide records and some level of protection against fraud</li>
  <li>Individual Photo Sales: Be cautious if the photographer insists on selling individual photos separately after the event. This can result in significantly higher costs than initially quoted. Ideally, your contract should include all agreed-upon services and the delivery of a complete set of edited photos</li>
  <li>Pressure Sales Tactics: Be wary of photographers who use high-pressure sales tactics or make unrealistic promises to secure your business</li>
  <li>Limited-Time Offers: Promising exclusive discounts or offers that are only available if you make an immediate decision</li>
</ul>

<p>Artiz Studio serves as a quintessential example of a questionable business practice. The studio lacks price transparency, often springing additional photo costs on unsuspecting customers. Their sales tactics can be aggressive, employing hard-sell techniques, and sometimes resorting to demeaning competitors. They heavily promote a supposed “Korean vibe” while concealing hidden costs that can catch customers off guard. They initially presented a price but later informed us of limited-time packages that required an immediate decision on that same day. While the photography displayed in this studio appeared beautiful, their aggressive sales tactics discouraged us from considering further transactions with them. It is advisable to steer clear of this establishment. It’s worth noting that several other photography studios employ similar practices, so it’s essential to be prepared for their direct approach.</p>

<p>To avoid falling victim to wedding photo scams:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research photographers thoroughly, read reviews, and ask for references</li>
  <li>Meet with potential photographers in person or via video call to assess their professionalism</li>
  <li>Request a detailed contract that outlines all services, fees, and terms</li>
  <li>Pay using secure methods, such as credit cards, which offer some protection against fraud</li>
  <li>Trust your instincts. If something doesn’t feel right, consider other options. Cross-reference online in all review sites and social media platforms. People will speak up if they feel their experience was subpar</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s crucial to exercise caution and due diligence when hiring a wedding photographer to ensure that your special day is captured beautifully and without any unpleasant surprises.</p>

Whilst it isn’t a country club, the establishment in its grandeur and luxury sure felt like one. Having personally experienced the allure of country clubs while being part of one in Hong Kong, I was naturally drawn to explore what Singapore’s country clubs have to offer. Today, we’ll unpack a little about country clubs, including the verdant landscapes and luxurious amenities and weighing the question on everyone’s mind: Are they worth it? Join me as we unravel the world of Singaporean country clubs and discover whether these exclusive enclaves truly live up to their reputation.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-5-cs-that-all-singaporeans-revere">What are the 5 C’s that all Singaporeans revere?</h4>

<p>In the realm of Singaporean culture and lifestyle, the “5 Cs” have long held a special place. Historically symbolizing cash, car, credit card, condominium and country club, these markers of affluence have shaped aspirations and defined success for generations of Singaporeans. These five Cs are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash: Refers to the pursuit of wealth and financial success</li>
  <li>Car: Singapore’s car prices are among the highest in the world due to significant taxes and fees, making car ownership a status symbol</li>
  <li>Credit Card: Self-explanatory, although getting a credit card was much more difficult a generation back</li>
  <li>Condo: Owned private real estate versus government housing (HDBs) is much more valuable (and comfortable)</li>
  <li>Country Club: Joining an exclusive country club is considered a symbol of prestige</li>
</ul>

<p>While the concept of the five C’s is often taken lightly, many Singaporeans adhere to its philosophy and aspire to ‘collect them all.’</p>

<h4 id="how-did-country-clubs-come-about-in-singapore">How did country clubs come about in Singapore?</h4>

<p>The roots of country clubs can be traced back to a time when colonial influences and British traditions shaped Singapore’s landscape. These clubs emerged as enclaves where colonial expatriates gathered to escape the tropical heat, indulge in recreational activities, and foster a sense of community. Over the decades, these exclusive retreats have evolved to become more diverse, catering to the changing demographics and interests of Singapore’s populace. However, this is also the reason why many country clubs are named after particular countries i.e. The American Club.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-you-join-a-country-club">Why should you join a country club?</h4>

<p>During my membership at a country club in Hong Kong, I dedicated the majority of my time to utilizing their tennis facilities, spending six days a week there for training. In fact, the country club became my third most frequently visited location, following my school and home. A good amount of my friends hung out there too. Looking back, I loved being part of that community. Here’s why there’s merit in joining a country club -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sanctuary lifestyle: At their core, country clubs in Singapore serve as sanctuaries, offering members an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban living. They are nestled amidst lush greenery, providing an oasis of tranquility where one can reconnect with nature, unwind, and recharge. It’s a place where time seems to slow down, and the stresses of daily life fade into the background</li>
  <li>Facilities: One of the defining features of country clubs is their extensive range of recreational facilities. While golf courses remain a hallmark, these clubs have diversified to include tennis courts, swimming pools, gyms, and even equestrian facilities. This diversity ensures that members of all ages can find activities that cater to their interests and fitness levels</li>
  <li>Fine dining: From casual poolside snacks to elegant fine dining experiences, these clubs boast a variety of dining options. Members can savor an array of cuisines and delight in gastronomic adventures, often accompanied by scenic views of the club’s sprawling grounds</li>
  <li>Networking: Beyond leisure and sports, country clubs play a pivotal role as social hubs. They provide a platform for networking and building relationships among individuals from diverse backgrounds. Memberships often span generations, creating a sense of community and continuity that extends beyond the club’s facilities</li>
  <li>Family activities: Many country clubs recognize the importance of family bonding. They offer family-friendly amenities, including children’s play areas, kid-focused activities, and even educational programs. These clubs become places where generations come together to create lasting memories</li>
  <li>Exclusive Events and Entertainment: Country clubs often host exclusive events, including gala dinners, themed parties, and cultural celebrations. These gatherings provide members with opportunities to socialize and enjoy unique entertainment experiences</li>
  <li>Prestige and Status: Joining a prestigious country club can enhance one’s social status and reputation, as these clubs are often associated with affluence and success</li>
  <li>Legacy and Tradition: Some members value the sense of tradition and heritage associated with country clubs. Membership often spans generations, creating a sense of continuity and belonging</li>

<h4 id="what-are-memberships-like">What are memberships like?</h4>

<p>On to the elephant in the room - how do memberships work?</p>

<p>Country clubs in Singapore typically offer various types of memberships to cater to the diverse preferences and needs of individuals and families. These memberships often include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ordinary or Full Membership: This is the most comprehensive and prestigious membership category, providing access to all club facilities and amenities, including golf courses, sports facilities, dining, and social events. Full members often have voting rights and may be required to pay an initiation fee and monthly dues. Some memberships are transferable - obviously, a transferable one is more expensive</li>
  <li>Associate Membership: Associate members enjoy most of the privileges of full membership but may have restrictions, such as limited access to certain facilities or no voting rights. Associate memberships are often available to family members of full members or individuals who do not meet the criteria for full membership.</li>
  <li>Social or Non-Golfing Membership: Social members typically have access to the club’s dining, social events, and some recreational facilities but do not have golfing privileges. This membership category is suitable for individuals or families who are primarily interested in the club’s social aspects.</li>
  <li>Corporate Membership: Corporate memberships are often offered to businesses and organizations. They provide access to club facilities for employees and clients. Corporate members may also use the club for business events and meetings.</li>
  <li>Term Membership: Term memberships are typically offered for a specific duration, such as one or two years. They are suitable for individuals who may want to experience the club for a limited time without a long-term commitment.</li>
  <li>Family Membership: Family memberships extend privileges to the member, their spouse, and dependent children. It provides a family-friendly environment with access to family-oriented amenities</li>
  <li>Sport membership: Primary access to sports facilities; often without voting rights</li>
</ul>

<p>To grossly summarize how much a country club membership costs -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry-level country clubs might have initiation fees ranging from SGD 5,000 to SGD 10,000, with annual subscription fees of around SGD 1,000 to SGD 3,000</li>
  <li>Mid-tier country clubs may require initiation fees of SGD 15,000 to SGD 30,000 or more, with annual subscription fees ranging from SGD 2,000 to SGD 5,000 or higher</li>
  <li>Premium and prestigious country clubs can have initiation fees exceeding SGD 50,000, and annual subscription fees can be in the range of SGD 5,000 to SGD 10,000 or more</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="so-are-country-clubs-worth-it">So are country clubs worth it?</h4>

<p>It depends. Ultimately, it’s often more about status, but if you spend a significant amount of time there and a country club offers a place for your children to socialize, it can be justifiable.</p>

Interestingly, most of my peers in Hong Kong, as well as my friends in Singapore, continue to live in their family homes if they remained in the same country post college graduation. Even in the case of marriage, a significant percentage of them choose to reside with their families unless they have accumulated enough resources to afford their own place. This trend is notably common in these two Asian countries, in contrast to the United States. Today, we’ll delve into the phenomenon of adults living with their parents and explore its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<h4 id="why-do-singaporeans-live-with-their-parents">Why do Singaporeans live with their parents?</h4>

<p>An estimated 97% of unmarried individuals between the ages of 15 and 34 lived with their parents in 2013. Whilst this number is from ten years ago, it’s still unfathomable for me to comprehend why someone would loiter at home for such a lengthy time frame. It’s a fascinating aspect of Singapore culture that often raises eyebrows among our international friends. Let’s unpack the reasons behind this unique lifestyle choice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cost of living
Let’s not sugarcoat it; living in Singapore can burn a hole in your pocket. With sky-high property prices and rent that can make your eyes water, it’s no wonder that many young adults opt to bunk with mum and dad. This financial strategy lets us save our hard-earned cash for other life goals, like furthering our education, kick-starting our careers, or exploring the world. This is the reason I hear the most from my local friends. It makes sense but also strips away from an independent lifestyle that can be priceless. We’ll touch on this later on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Filial piety and family values
Now, here’s where it gets heartwarming. Rooted in Confucian values, it’s all about respecting and caring for our parents, especially as they grow older. Living under the same roof is seen as a tangible way to show love and respect. It’s like a warm, perpetual family hug that keeps family bonds strong. However, I see staying at home as a poor reason for filial piety, especially amongst the younger generation. You can still be taking care of your parents without living with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A built-in support system
Who doesn’t love a solid support system? Living with family means you’ve got a tribe to rely on—be it for sage advice, a hand with chores, or simply some good old-fashioned company. In fact, many of us owe our sanity to this network of support. Grandparents often join in on the fun, pitching in with childcare duties and adding extra layers of love to the mix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practicality and convenience
Living at home is the epitome of convenience. No more worries about grocery shopping, cooking, or laundry—parents often take the reins. This means more time and energy to dedicate to careers and personal growth. Plus, parents are usually more than happy to lend a helping hand—whether it’s whipping up breakfast or offering a ride to work. I hate this reason personally given it just sounds like freeloading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of pressure to move out
Unlike in some Western cultures, where moving out is the badge of adulthood, Singaporeans face zero societal pressure to vacate the family nest. In fact, it’s perfectly normal, widely accepted, and definitely no reason to raise an eyebrow. This is something that is changing in Singapore’s societal fabric, and something I want all Singaporeans to challenge.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it, folks! Living with parents in Singapore is about more than just saving a few bucks; it’s a reflection of our rich cultural values of filial piety, strong family bonds, and unwavering support. Whether it’s for financial stability, emotional connection, or the sheer joy of sharing life’s moments with loved ones, bunking with Mom and Dad is a lifestyle choice that’s here to stay.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-deal-with-multi-generational-living">What’s the deal with multi-generational living?</h4>

<p>In many Singaporean families, it’s common for several generations to reside under one roof, even when parents are old and have children of their own. In fact, the number of resident households increased from 1,145,900 households in 2010 to 1,372,600 households in 2020. Not to go too much into this topic, but root causes of filial piety, economic considerations and practical benefits contribute to such phenomenon.</p>

<h4 id="the-flip-side-and-the-challenges-that-come-with-staying-at-home">The flip side and the challenges that come with staying at home</h4>

<p>Between 1990 and 2020 the number of those under 35 who lived alone or with non-family members grew from 33,400 to 51,300 (The economist). Additionally, local real estate portal PropertyGuru showed seven in 10 respondents between the ages of 22 and 39 were considering moving out. This shows the growing trend of Singaporeans leaving home. Let’s unpack the reasons why.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Space Squeeze
Singapore is a tiny red dot on the map, and boy, my friends feel it when they’re all cozying up in the same apartment. With property prices soaring higher than our aspirations, limited living space can be a real buzzkill. Forget personal space; it’s more like “Can I please have any space?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independence
Living with your parents well into adulthood can make it tough to carve out your own identity. While other twenty- and thirty-somethings around the world are out there solo-traveling, building their empires, or even just decorating their own pads, we might feel like we’re in a bit of a holding pattern. I feel maximum 25 years old is the age where one should move out. This way, it feels like you can structure life to your own accord.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dating dilemmas
Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: dating. In a city where the dating game is already challenging, explaining that you live with Mom and Dad can add an extra layer of complexity. It’s like a rite of passage—eventually, we all hope to have a place to call our own for those romantic rendezvous. We covered dating in a previous article - it’s much better to have your own abode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parental power
Ah, the classic “When are you getting married?” and “Why aren’t you home yet?” questions that can drive us up the wall. Living under the same roof might mean dealing with a bit more parental pester power than you’d like. They mean well, but sometimes, you just need your own space to breathe. Leaving home equates to being in control of your own life. No monetary ties, no decisions influenced by parents if you don’t want their opinions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The boomerang effect
It’s all fun and games until you decide it’s time to spread your wings and fly. But what if you’ve been under your parents’ roof for so long that you’ve forgotten how to adult on your own? The boomerang effect—a return to the nest after an attempt at independence—can be a humbling experience, to say the least. Leaving your parent’s roof doesn’t mean you won’t come back or won’t take care of them either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="additional-pull-factors-of-leaving-home">Additional pull factors of leaving home</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing number of co-living spaces
Co-living spaces have gained popularity worldwide, offering an affordable, community-oriented housing solution. Singapore could promote the development of such spaces designed for young adults. These environments foster independence while providing essential amenities and a built-in support system. Think Hmlet in Singapore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Career opportunities beyond Singapore
Sometimes, the best way to encourage independence is to expand horizons. Singaporean companies and the government can promote overseas work opportunities, internships, or exchange programs. These experiences not only help young adults gain independence but also broaden their perspectives. Singapore is a huge bubble, hence I always encourage locals here to go abroad if their means can afford it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changing mindsets
There is a shifting societal norm and a growing emphasis on independence, which will lead to a healthier peer pressure to move out of one’s parental home.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Living with your parents as an adult in Singapore can be a double-edged sword. While it offers financial stability, emotional closeness, and an unwavering support system, it also comes with space constraints, identity challenges, and a few extra dating hurdles. But hey, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer here. Whether you’re nesting with Mom and Dad or spreading your wings into the unknown, the important thing is finding what works for you.</p>
