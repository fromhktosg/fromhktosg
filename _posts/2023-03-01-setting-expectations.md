My manager has always told me to underpromise and overdeliver. Hence, here's a list of what you can expect from my blog.

+ I will post once a week. Either Wednesday and Saturday is what I’m thinking at the moment. I used to post twice a week but things got busy. If things become more free, I'll be back to posting twice a week
+ I will share in different content formats. Listicles, op-eds, reflections… all possible
+ My thoughts are my own. I am not representing my company, my friends or my ‘culture'
+ I will avoid politics. This is going to be difficult, given politics is so intertwined with a city’s development and socio-economic issues. I will do my best
+ I will compare countries. Mostly Hong Kong and Singapore. Occasionally the US as well. As much as the comparisons will be grounded in data, extrapolations and conclusions will be my own. You may disagree with me and I welcome that - just be respectful
+ I will be honest. There are things that I love about Singapore and other things that I detest. I'll provide my honest opinion about living here
+ I will try to help. The goal of this blog is to 1)help those who are considering a move to Singapore and 2)help those in Singapore to better settle in and thrive. Please reach out if you have specific questions and I’ll be happy to discuss further

This might evolve. In due time.
