My manager has always told me to underpromise and overdeliver. Hence, here's a list of what you can expect from my blog.

+ I will post twice a week. Wednesday and Saturday is what I’m thinking at the moment. If it's a busy week, expect content on only one of those days
+ I will share in different content formats. Listicles, op-eds, reflections… all possible
+ My thoughts are my own. I am not representing my company, my friends, my ‘culture'
+ I will avoid politics. This is going to be difficult, given politics is so intertwined with a city’s development and socio-economic issues. I will do my best
+ I will compare Hong Kong and Singapore. Occasionally the US as well. As much as the comparisons will be grounded in data, extrapolations and conclusions will be my own. You may disagree with me and I welcome that - just be respectful
+ I will try to help. The goal of this blog is to help those who are considering a move from Hong Kong to Singapore. Please reach out if you have specific questions and I’ll be happy to discuss further

This might evolve. In due time.
