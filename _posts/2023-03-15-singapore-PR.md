Let’s begin with the obvious disclaimer - I’m not a lawyer. However, I did manage to become a Singapore permanent resident in just one attempt so I’ll be sharing my take on the application process and some tips and tricks I learnt along the way.

One thing I’ll say upfront - don’t bother with immigration agencies. They’re expensive with limited upside and sell you on weird gimmicks like PR success calculators. All my friends who engaged with one regretted their decision and failed to get residency. It’s not a stat sig sample size but it’s telling. Let’s start off with the basics.

#### What does Singapore permanent residency (PR) mean?

Singapore PR is an immigration status that allows individuals to live, work and study in Singapore without a set time limit (though there is a little more nuance to this, as discussed later in the post). There are approximately [520K](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/population-and-population-structure/latest-data) PRs in Singapore, making up 9% of the total population. Annually, there’s a [~30K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency_in_Singapore) cap on the number of PRs granted, with an estimated 100K applications.


#### What are the different ways to get Singapore permanent residency?

There are 3 main tracks to get Singapore PR. These exclude students applying, or Singapore citizens / PRs applying for their parents / spouse.

1. Global Investor Program ([GIP](https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/how-we-help/global-investor-programme.html))

    [Apply for PR](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/singapore-global-investor-programme-higher-investment-quantum-3317416) by 1) investing $10 million in starting a business, 2) investing $25 million in GIP-selected funds, 3) set up a Singapore-based single family office with at least $200 million AUM. From 2020 - 2022, [~200 PR applications](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/about-200-individuals-granted-pr-status-through-global-investor-programme-3298491) were approved from the GIP track. Pretty easy for anyone who has money to throw around.

2. Foreign Artistic Talent scheme

 For those who are talented and can meet all the minimum requirements [below](https://www.nac.gov.sg/support/capability-development/leadership-career-and-artistic-development/foreign-artistic-talent-scheme-(forarts)):
 + ‘Possess relevant training/education in your field of practice
 + Possess relevant professional experience, with outstanding achievements, in the field of Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Literary Arts, Design and/or Media
 + Have made significant contributions to Singapore’s arts and cultural scene, including a strong track record of local engagements at leadership level
 + Have concrete future plans to be involved in Singapore’s arts and cultural sector’
 
 Probably not for most plebeians.

3. Professionals/Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers Scheme (PTS)

 This is the majority track, for those with Employment Passes (EPs) to apply for PR. I applied through this method as evidently, I did not have the money or artistic talent.

What’s important to note is that ‘main applicants who are granted PR status under the [Professionals/Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers Scheme or the Investor Scheme](https://www.ica.gov.sg/reside/PR/apply), are exempted from National Service’. Hurrah.

#### Why apply for PR and what benefits does it provide?


##### Stay in the country without restrictions
The most important factor in my POV. In this current layoff climate, PR has emerged as a strong reassurance for those who want to stay in the country. Additionally, you can apply for long term visit passes (LTVPs) for your parents if they want to stay in Singapore for a while.


##### Job opportunity advantages
This manifests in threefold. First, the government has regulations that ensure citizens and PRs have priority to job opportunities. ‘Employers are required to [advertise a job position](https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/employment-pass/what-changes-to-my-job-advertisement-in-jobs-bank-will-require-me-to-extend-it-for-another-14-days-before-i-can-apply-for-an-ep) for 14 days’ before they can apply for an Employment Pass for that position. Second, an employment pass only allows you to perform your full time job whilst a PR allows you to dabble in other income-making ventures. Third, job retraining benefits are provided to upskill / if you are retrenched (Singapore’s way of addressing unemployment).


##### Buy HDB resale flats
Not the biggest factor for most, with a multitude of [caveats](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-guides/how-do-singapore-permanent-residents-buy-a-hdb-flat-9914). A single PR is not eligible to buy a HDB resale flat either.

##### CPF contribution
401K (US) / MPF (HK) equivalent to a pension fund. A plus and a minus. It does help with savings and provides stable interest rates, but most are better off investing that money elsewhere with higher returns.

##### Eligible for Singapore citizenship
PR is the stepping stone to Singapore citizenship. Great for those with weak passports or those who want to settle in the country long term.

#### What are the drawbacks of Singapore PR?

Two primary ones:

1. PRs are subject to Re-Entry Permit ([REP](https://www.ica.gov.sg/reside/PR/apply-REP)) requirements if they wish to leave Singapore for any length of time

 REPs are required to re-enter Singapore. They expire every 5 years, so despite PR providing a path to stay in the country on paper, REP is what really determines whether you keep your Singapore PR. Renewal factors include whether you are paying taxes, working in Singapore etc. This ensures those with PR status are actually present in and contributing to Singapore.

2. National service liability
 The true bogeyman in the room. ‘[Male applicants](https://www.ica.gov.sg/reside/PR/apply) who are granted PR status as a Foreign Student or under their parents’ sponsorship are required to register for NS upon reaching 16½ years old and will be scheduled for enlistment at the earliest opportunity upon reaching 18 years old’. Be it on a safety or best use of time standpoint, this is the main deterrent for applying to PR amongst my peer group.

#### What are the factors of a successful PR applicant?

Here is a checklist based off successful PR applications I know:

+ Professional experience: Having a well-reputed and well-paying job that fills a talent gap in Singapore helps (i.e. R&D, tech). It shows that you are able to contribute to Singapore’s economy both from a talent and taxes standpoint

+ Education level: The higher the better (at least a Bachelor’s degree). You’re competing against the best so I’d think this is a must

+ Age: Younger the better given an aging population

+ Duration of stay: No hard and fast rule but I’d recommend those who are applying to have spent 2+ years in the country. It shows commitment and integration

+ Integration with Singapore society: The most important factor in my POV given Singapore’s emphasis on harmony. Immigration agencies recommend applicants to donate or volunteer time to show they care about local causes and individuals. Whilst I don’t think it’s necessary, it’s part of the integration angle

So why is getting PR such a difficult ordeal? The high volume of applicants is one. Some also say there are quotas based on racial [proportions](https://www.gov.sg/article/what-are-the-racial-proportions-among-singapore-citizens) that mirror Singapore’s societal composition, given ‘the proportions of each race in Singapore’s citizen population have remained stable’ across twenty years. However, there is no concrete data around quotas based on race, hence nor will I speculate.

#### My own PR application experience

I applied for PR during the COVID days in Feb 2020. The process took nine months (avg time on ICA’s website is 6 months) and I was notified of the results in Nov 2020.

My personal credentials and success factors based off the checklist above are -
+ Business role in a large tech company with stellar track record of performance and trajectory
+ Bachelor's degree in a top 25 degree university in the world
+ Late 20s without children
+ Stayed in the country for 2.5 years
+ Cantonese-speaking and from HK (helps with integration I assume?). **This is one advantage I see HK people have given the similarities between both locations**

As part of my application, I also attached a few value-add documents to help myself stand out. Whilst there isn’t a formal space for value-add documents, just upload these docs in any open file slots in the application. These docs include:
+ **Cover letter** - my background, why Singapore and how I can contribute and integrate to society
+ **2 letters of recommendation from Singapore citizens** - how we know each other, why I’ll be good for the country
+ **Resume** - my professional qualifications and academic background

Others also attach their awards or volunteer certifications but I didn’t have any of that. Feel free to reach out to me for a copy of my cover letter and references. 

I was one happy trooper when I found out my application was successful. I had low expectations anyway. I’ll end by saying if your application is not successful, just try again after a year, but make sure there’s a material change in your application when you reapply i.e. change in jobs, family status.
