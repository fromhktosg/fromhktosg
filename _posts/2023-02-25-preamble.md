Welcome to my blog, a place where I can share my perspective and experience of moving from Hong Kong to Singapore.

I'm a Hong Kong-er in his late 20s who has lived in Singapore for the past 5 years. I've been wanting to start this blog for a while. Various reasons delayed its creation, with the primary one being ‘I haven’t been in Singapore long enough’. As someone who likes to observe and absorb, I felt there was always more to take in before I drew any respectable conclusions. This is especially pertinent when it comes to comparing cities. A city’s fabric and texture changes over time, and needless to say, Singapore and Hong Kong are two places that have changed immensely.

As I hit my 5 year mark in Singapore, I felt now was a good time to share. Perhaps there is some magic to this nice rounded number, or maybe it feels like both places have calmed down from the past few years of chaos. After all, Covid has been relegated to ‘just another flu’, travel is back and interest rates are up. Heck, even Lindsay Lohan is back to making movies. One thing that remained consistent though is the comparison between Hong Kong and Singapore. It’s a never-ending arms race, in which crafty jabs from netizens, politicians and policies come back and forth. The media blows this out of proportion, but then again, what doesn’t the media blow out of proportion? An on the ground perspective matters so much more than what SCMP and Strait Times says - that’s where I come in. We’ll be diving into societal issues and examining slices of life between the two countries, from housing, education, prevalence of greenery to best dim sum places. I hope this blog provides a little insight into each of these havens and helps those who are exploring a move from Hong Kong to Singapore.

Best,

David
