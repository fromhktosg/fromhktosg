<p>Shopping malls have become an integral part of Singapore’s urban landscape, with their ubiquitous presence contributing significantly to the city’s social, economic, and cultural fabric. These vast complexes have become more than mere retail destinations, but rather serve as multifaceted hubs of activity where Singaporeans can meet, shop, dine, and socialize. In this post we will delve into the critical role that shopping malls play, the popular malls in town and overall shopping strategy in Singapore.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-shopping-malls-everywhere-in-singapore">Why are shopping malls everywhere in Singapore</h4>

<p>Every MRT stop has a shopping mall. Almost every. Why is that the case?</p>

<p>One of the reasons why many MRT stations in Singapore have shopping malls is because of the government’s urban planning strategy. The government has been actively promoting the concept of “integrated developments” where residential, commercial, and transportation facilities are located in close proximity to each other. This strategy aims to promote convenience and accessibility for residents and visitors to Singapore.</p>

<p>In the case of MRT stations, the idea is to create a seamless and convenient shopping experience for commuters. By having shopping malls located directly adjacent to MRT stations, commuters can easily access these malls without having to walk long distances or take additional transportation. This also provides an opportunity for businesses to benefit from the high traffic flow of commuters passing through the MRT stations.</p>

<p>Additionally, the government also aims to encourage the development of commercial spaces within the city to increase employment opportunities and boost the economy. Having shopping malls connected to MRT stations can attract more visitors, further increasing the commercial value of these spaces. This is not rocket science given a similar model exists in JP and HK.</p>

<h4 id="the-role-of-shopping-malls-in-singapore">The role of shopping malls in Singapore</h4>

<p>Shopping malls have emerged as essential spaces for social interaction, providing a comfortable and safe environment for people to connect with friends and family. Malls offer a myriad of entertainment options, including cinemas, game arcades, and food courts, making them an ideal location for people to spend their leisure time. The presence of social amenities such as restrooms, nursing rooms, and free Wi-Fi makes shopping malls an attractive location for people from all walks of life to come together and interact.</p>

<p>In fact, shopping malls are crucial drivers of Singapore’s economy, offering a wide range of job opportunities in the retail and non-retail sectors. Singapore’s malls attract a significant number of tourists who come to experience the city’s vibrant shopping scene, contributing to Singapore’s economy through their expenditure on retail, food, and accommodation. Shopping malls also play an essential role in creating a thriving retail industry that generates jobs and income for Singaporeans.</p>

<p>Shopping malls play a critical role in Singapore’s urban planning and development, forming part of larger integrated developments that include residential, office, and hotel components. These developments create a vibrant and diverse environment that provides a holistic experience for residents, workers, and visitors alike. They also contribute to the value of the surrounding properties, leading to a multiplier effect on the overall growth of the local economy. And free aircon is great.</p>

<h4 id="loyalty-programs">Loyalty programs</h4>

<p>An explosion of shopping mall loyalty programs have cropped up in the past few years. Along with loyalty points, malls have credit card partnerships that open up to further discounts. Here are a couple of examples -</p>
<ul>

<h4 id="my-two-cents-of-shopping-in-singapore-versus-in-hk">My two cents of shopping in Singapore versus in HK</h4>

<p>We’re referring to shopping for goods vs groceries here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Singapore is more expensive due to sales tax. Take Uniqlo in SG vs HK. Hong Kong is cheaper. Same with the US</li>
  <li>All the essential brands are there. For luxury, you’ll be able to get most of the latest items although they do run out quick</li>
  <li>There’s a lot less foot traffic versus Hong Kong. This makes shopping more comfortable and relaxing. This might change when tourists flood back in both countries</li>
  <li>Consistent quality of mid-tier shopping malls. Few large scale luxury malls exist, but for all the mid-tier ones, they are of consistent quality across the nation. Food options are similar and store options are similar</li>
  <li>Limited number of boutiques and thrifts</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>My recommendation - only buy essentials or things that really catch your eye in Singapore. Buy luxury abroad for tax refund and buy staples and boutiques abroad for a wider selection at a lower price. If you really have to buy, I’d recommend going to MBS as the loyalty program is more friendly.  All that being said, Singapore’s shopping malls are some of the best in the world. With plenty of aircon to shelter from heat and a plethora of dining and shops options, shopping malls have become a haven and pastime for locals. I love my malls and so should you.</p>
